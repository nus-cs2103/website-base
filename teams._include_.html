        <p><strong>The two teams</strong>:<br> You will be in two different teams at different times of the semester.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Week 1 - 5: Phase A team</li>
          <li>Week 6 - 13: Phase B team (i.e. Project team)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Phase A (Weeks 1 - 5) is the period for strengthening individual competencies. By working with different classmates during this period you get to know and learn from more classmates. The project is done in phase B. That means your Phase B team
          is also your project team.</p>

<p><mark>There cannot be any overlap between your 2 teams</mark>. For example, any member from your Phase A team cannot be a member of your Phase B team.</p>
<p><strong>When to form teams</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>CS2103T: Your phase A team will be formed by CS2101 side in week 1. Your phase B team (applicable to CS2101 too) will be formed by CS2103T side on week 5.</li>
  <li>CS2103: Form tentative Phase A teams in week 2 (during the tutorial). Finalize phase A team in the subsequent tutorial. Form phase B team on week 5.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Team size</strong>: The default <mark>team size is four</mark>. Please do not form teams with five or more.</p>
<p><strong>Team ID</strong>: This will be given to you after forming teams in each phase. It has the form <code>TUTORIAL_ID-PHASE+TEAM_NUMBER</code> e.g, <code>W14-A2</code> means you are in tutorial W14 (i.e., Wed 1400-1500), phase A, team 2.</p>
<p><strong>Team composition</strong></p>
<p>We allow some freedom in choosing team members, subject to these constraints:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Teams of <mark>single nationality are not allowed</mark> (rationale: to train you to work in multicultural teams). However, we allow same nationality teams if the only language common among all team members is English. e.g. an all-Singaporean team
      that include both Chinese and Malay students.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No more than one exchange students per team (rationale: to increase interaction between exchange students and NUS students).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All team members should be in the same tutorial. <mark>Delay forming teams until your place in a tutorial is confirmed.</mark> We do not allow changing tutorials to team up with your preferred team mates.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Also note that we may modify teams when circumstances call for it. There is no avenue for you to object. Staying with your preferred team is not guaranteed.</p>
  </li>
