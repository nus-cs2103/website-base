    <p>The following description of the <em>Joys of the Programming Craft</em> was taken from Chapter 1 of the famous book
      <trigger for="modal:mmm" trigger="click"><em>The Mythical Man-Month</em>, by Frederick P. Brooks</trigger>.</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><strong>Why is programming fun? What delights may its practitioner expect as his reward?</strong></p>
      <p>First is the sheer joy of making things. As the child delights in his mud pie, so the adult enjoys building things, especially things of his own design. I think this delight must be an image of God's delight in making things, a delight shown in
        the distinctness and newness of each leaf and each snowflake.</p>
      <p>Second is the pleasure of making things that are useful to other people. Deep within, we want others to use our work and to find it helpful. In this respect the programming system is not essentially different from the child's first clay pencil holder
        &quot;for Daddy's office.&quot;</p>
      <p>Third is the fascination of fashioning complex puzzle-like objects of interlocking moving parts and watching them work in subtle cycles, playing out the consequences of principles built in from the beginning. The programmed computer has all the
        fascination of the pinball machine or the jukebox mechanism, carried to the ultimate.</p>
      <p>Fourth is the joy of always learning, which springs from the nonrepeating nature of the task. In one way or another the problem is ever new, and its solver learns something: sometimes practical, sometimes theoretical, and sometimes both.</p>
      <p>Finally, there is the delight of working in such a tractable medium. The programmer, like the poet, works only slightly removed from pure thought-stuff. He builds his castles in the air, from air, creating by the exertion of the imagination. Few
        media of creation are so flexible, so easy to polish and rework, so readily capable of realizing grand conceptual structures....</p>
      <p>Yet the program construct, unlike the poet's words, is real in the sense that it moves and works, producing visible outputs separate from the construct itself. It prints results, draws pictures, produces sounds, moves arms. The magic of myth and
        legend has come true in our time. One types the correct incantation on a keyboard, and a display screen comes to life, showing things that never were nor could be.</p>
      <p>Programming then is fun because it gratifies creative longings built deep within us and delights sensibilities we have in common with all men.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <p><strong>Not all is delight, however, and knowing the inherent woes makes it easier to bear them when they appear.</strong></p>
      <p>First, one must perform perfectly. The computer resembles the magic of legend in this respect, too. If one character, one pause, of the incantation is not strictly in proper form, the magic doesn't work. Human beings are not accustomed to being
        perfect, and few areas of human activity demand it. Adjusting to the requirement for perfection is, I think, the most difficult part of learning to program.</p>
      <p>Next, other people set one's objectives, provide one's resources, and furnish one's information. One rarely controls the circumstances of his work, or even its goal. In management terms, one's authority is not sufficient for his responsibility.
        It seems that in all fields, however, the jobs where things get done never have formal authority commensurate with responsibility. In practice, actual (as opposed to formal) authority is acquired from the very momentum of accomplishment.</p>
      <p>The dependence upon others has a particular case that is especially painful for the system programmer. He depends upon other people's programs. These are often maldesigned, poorly implemented, incompletely delivered (no source code or test cases),
        and poorly documented. So he must spend hours studying and fixing things that in an ideal world would be complete, available, and usable.</p>
      <p>The next woe is that designing grand concepts is fun; finding nitty little bugs is just work. With any creative activity come dreary hours of tedious, painstaking labor, and programming is no exception.</p>
      <p>Next, one finds that debugging has a linear convergence, or worse, where one somehow expects a quadratic sort of approach to the end. So testing drags on and on, the last difficult bugs taking more time to find than the first.</p>
      <p>The last woe, and sometimes the last straw, is that the product over which one has labored so long appears to be obsolete upon (or before) completion. Already colleagues and competitors are in hot pursuit of new and better ideas. Already the displacement
        of one's thought-child is not only conceived, but scheduled.</p>
      <p>This always seems worse than it really is. The new and better product is generally not available when one completes his own; it is only talked about. It, too, will require months of development. The real tiger is never a match for the paper one,
        unless actual use is wanted. Then the virtues of reality have a satisfaction all their own.</p>
      <p>Of course the technological base on which one builds is always advancing. As soon as one freezes a design, it becomes obsolete in terms of its concepts. But implementation of real products demands phasing and quantizing. The obsolescence of an implementation
        must be measured against other existing implementations, not against unrealized concepts. The challenge and the mission are to find real solutions to real problems on actual schedules with available resources.</p>
      <p>This then is programming, both a tar pit in which many efforts have floundered and a creative activity with joys and woes all its own. For many, the joys far outweigh the woes....</p>

    <p><strong>Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a <em>programming paradigm</em>.</strong> A programming paradigm guides programmers to analyze programming problems, and structure programming solutions, in a specific way.</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>Programming languages have traditionally divided the world into two parts—data and operations on data. Data is static and immutable, except as the operations may change it. The procedures and functions that operate on data have no lasting state
        of their own; they’re useful only in their ability to affect data.</p>
      <p>This division is, of course, grounded in the way computers work, so it’s not one that you can easily ignore or push aside. Like the equally pervasive distinctions between matter and energy and between nouns and verbs, it forms the background against
        which we work. At some point, all programmers—even object-oriented programmers—must lay out the data structures that their programs will use and define the functions that will act on the data.</p>
      <p>With a procedural programming language like C, that’s about all there is to it. The language may offer various kinds of support for organizing data and functions, but it won’t divide the world any differently. Functions and data structures are the
        basic elements of design.</p>
      <p>Object-oriented programming doesn’t so much dispute this view of the world as restructure it at a higher level. It groups operations and data into modular units called objects and lets you combine objects into structured networks to form a complete
        program. In an object-oriented programming language, objects and object interactions are the basic elements of design.</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>Every object has both state (data) and behavior (operations on data). In that, they’re not much different from ordinary physical objects. It’s easy to see how a mechanical device, such as a pocket watch or a piano, embodies both state and behavior.
        But almost anything that’s designed to do a job does, too. Even simple things with no moving parts such as an ordinary bottle combine state (how full the bottle is, whether or not it’s open, how warm its contents are) with behavior (the ability
        to dispense its contents at various flow rates, to be opened or closed, to withstand high or low temperatures).</p>
      <p>It’s this resemblance to real things that gives objects much of their power and appeal. They can not only model components of real systems, but equally as well fulfill assigned roles as components in software systems.</p>

    </blockquote>
    <p><strong>Object Oriented Programming (OOP) views the world as <em>a network of interacting objects</em>.</strong></p>
    <tip-box>
      <p>📦 A real world scenario viewed as a network of interacting objects:</p>
      <p>You are asked to find out the average age of a group of people Adam, Beth, Charlie, and Daisy. You take a piece of paper and pen, go to each person, ask for their age, and note it down. After collecting the age of all four, you enter it into a calculator
        to find the total. And then, use the same calculator to divide the total by four, to get the average age. This can be viewed as the objects <code>You</code>, <code>Pen</code>, <code>Paper</code>, <code>Calculator</code>, <code>Adam</code>, <code>Beth</code>,
        <code>Charlie</code>, and <code>Daisy</code> interacting to accomplish to achieve the end result of calculating the average age of the four persons. These objects can be considered as connected in a certain network of certain structure.</p>
    </tip-box>
    <p><strong>OOP solutions try to create a similar object network inside the computer’s memory</strong> – a sort of a virtual simulation of the corresponding real world scenario – <strong>so that a similar result can be achieved programmatically.</strong></p>

    <p><strong>OOP does not demand that the virtual world object network follow the real world <em>exactly</em>.</strong></p>
    <tip-box>
      <p>📦 Our previous example can be tweaked a bit as follows:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Use an object called <code>Main</code> to represent your role in the scenario.</li>
        <li>As there is no physical writing involved, we can replace the <code>Pen</code> and <code>Paper</code> with an object called <code>AgeList</code> that is able to keep a list of ages.</li>
      </ul>
    </tip-box>
    <p><strong>Every object has both state (data) and behavior (operations on data).</strong></p>

      <p>📦 The interface and implementation of some real-world objects in our example:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Calculator: the buttons and the display are part of the interface; circuits are part of the implementation.</li>
        <li>Adam: In the context of our 'calculate average age' example, the interface of Adam consists of requests that adam will respond to, e.g. &quot;Give age to the nearest year, as at Jan 1st of this year&quot; &quot;State your name&quot;; the implementation
          includes the mental calculation Adam uses to calculate the age which is not visible to other objects.</li>

    <p><strong>Objects interact by sending messages.</strong></p>
    <p>Both real world and virtual world object interactions can be viewed as objects sending message to each other. The message can result in the sender object receiving a response and/or the receiving object’s state being changed. Furthermore, the result
      can vary based on which object received the message, even if the message is identical <span class="dimmed">(see rows 1 and 2 in the example below)</span>.</p>

      <p>When writing an OOP program to calculate the average age of Adam, Beth, Charlie, and Daisy, instructions for creating objects <code>Adam</code>, <code>Beth</code>, <code>Charlie</code>, and <code>Daisy</code> will be very similar because they are
        all of the same kind : they all represent ‘persons’ with the same interface, the same kind of data (i.e. <code>name</code>, <code>DoB</code>, etc.), and the same kind of behavior (i.e. <code>getAge(Date)</code>, <code>getName()</code>, etc.).
        Therefore, we can have a class called <code>Person</code> containing instructions on how to create <code>Person</code> objects and use that class to instantiate objects <code>Adam</code>, <code>Beth</code>, <code>Charlie</code>, and <code>Daisy</code>.
        Similarly, we need classes <code>AgeList</code>, <code>Calculator</code>, and <code>Main</code> classes to instantiate one each of <code>AgeList</code>, <code>Calculator</code>, and <code>Main</code> objects.</p>
    </tip-box>

    <p>Let us use the UML notation to illustrate classes and objects under discussion.</p>

      <p>📦 All <code>Person</code> objects have the <code>Name</code> attribute but the value of that attribute varies between <code>Person</code> objects.</p>
    </tip-box>
    <p>However, some attributes are not suitable to be maintained by individual objects. Instead, they should be maintained centrally, shared by all objects of the class.

      <p>📦 The attribute <code>totalPersons</code> should be maintained centrally and shared by all <code>Person</code> objects rather than copied at each <code>Person</code> object.</p>

    <p>Similarly, when a normal method is being called, a message is being sent to the receiving object and the result may depend on the receiving object.</p>
    <tip-box>
      <p>📦 Sending the <code>getName()</code> message to <code>Adam</code> object results in the response <code>&quot;Adam&quot;</code> while sending the same message to the <code>Beth</code> object gets the response <code>&quot;Beth&quot;</code>.</p>

    <p>However, there can be methods related to a specific class but not suitable for sending message to a specific object of that class. Such <strong>methods that are called using the class instead of a specific instance are called <mark><em>class-level methods</em></mark></strong>.</p>

However, the two classes cannot be simply replaced with a more general class <code>Person</code> because of the need to distinguish between <code>Man</code>        and <code>Woman</code> for the ‘marriage’ association.

    <p>Take the example of writing a payroll application for a university to facilitate payroll processing of university staff. Suppose an <code>adjustSalary(int)</code> operation adjusts the salaries of all staff members. This operation will be executed
      whenever the university initiates a salary adjustment for its staff. However, the adjustment formula is different for different staff categories, say admin and academic. Here is one possible way of designing the classes in the <code>Payroll</code>      system.</p>
    <tip-box>
      <p>📦 Calling <code>adjustSalary()</code> method for each Staff type:</p>
      <img src="/book/oopDesign/polymorphism/introduction/images/payroll.png" height="150">
      <p></p>
      <p>Here is the implementation of the <code>adjustSalary(int)</code> operation from the above design.</p>
      <pre><code class="hljs java"><span class="hljs-class"><span class="hljs-keyword">class</span> <span class="hljs-title">Payroll1</span> </span>{
    ArrayList&lt; Admin &gt; admins;

            ad.adjustSalary(byPercent);
        }
        <span class="hljs-keyword">for</span> (Academic ac: academics) {
            ac.adjustSalary(byPercent);
        }
    }
}

    <p>Note how processing is similar for the two staff types. It is as if the type of staff members is irrelevant to how they are processed inside this operation! If that is the case, can the staff type be &quot;abstracted away&quot; from this method? Here
      is such an implementation of <code>adjustSalary(int)</code>:</p>
    <tip-box>
      <pre><code class="hljs java"><span class="hljs-class"><span class="hljs-keyword">class</span> <span class="hljs-title">Payroll2</span> </span>{
    ArrayList&lt; Staff &gt; staff;
    <span class="hljs-comment">// ...</span>

    <span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">void</span> <span class="hljs-title">adjustSalary</span><span class="hljs-params">(<span class="hljs-keyword">int</span> byPercent)</span> </span>{
        <span class="hljs-keyword">for</span> (Staff s: staff) {
            s.adjustSalary(byPercent);
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>
      <p>Notice the following:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Only one data structure <code>ArrayList&lt; Staff &gt;</code>. It contains both <code>Admin</code> and <code>Academic</code> objects but treats them as <code>Staff</code> objects</li>
        <li>Only one loop</li>
        <li>Outcome of the <code>s.adjustSalary(byPercent)</code> method call depends on whether <code>s</code> is an <code>Academic</code> or <code>Admin</code> object</li>
      </ul>
    </tip-box>
    <p>The above code is better in several ways:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>It is shorter.</li>
      <li>It is simpler.</li>
      <li>It is more flexible (this code will remain the same even if more staff types are added).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This does not mean we are getting rid of the <code>Academic</code> and <code>Admin</code> classes completely and replacing them with a more general class called <code>Staff</code>. Rather, this part of the code “treats” both <code>Admin</code> and
      <code>Academic</code> objects as one type called <code>Staff</code>.</p>
    <p>For example, <code>ArrayList</code> staff contains both <code>Admin</code> and <code>Academic</code> objects although it treats all of them as <code>Staff</code> objects. However, when the <code>adjustSalary(int)</code> operation of these objects
      is called, the resulting salary adjustment will be different for <code>Admin</code> objects and <code>Academic</code> objects. Therefore, different types of objects are treated as a single general type, but yet each type of object exhibits a different
      kind of behavior. This is called <em>polymorphism</em> (literally, it means “ability to take many forms”). In this example, an object that is perceived as type <code>Staff</code> can be an <code>Admin</code> object or an <code>Academic</code> object.</p>

  <div>
    <p><strong>Three concepts combine to achieve polymorphism: <em>substitutability, operation overriding, and dynamic binding</em>.</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Substitutability:</strong> Because of substitutability, you can write code that expects object of a parent class and yet use that code with objects of child classes. That is how polymorphism is able to <em>treat objects of different types as one type</em>.</li>
      <li><strong>Overriding:</strong> To get polymorphic behavior from an operation, the operation in the superclass needs to be overridden in each of the subclasses. That is how overriding allows objects of different sub classes to <em>display different behaviors in response to the same method call</em>.</li>
      <li><strong>Dynamic binding</strong>: Calls to overridden methods are bound to the implementation of the actual object's class dynamically during the runtime. That is how the polymorphic code can call the method of the parent class and yet execute the
        implementation of the child class.</li>

    <p>Overloading is used to indicate that multiple operations do similar things but take different parameters. Overloaded methods have the same method name but different method signatures and possibly different return types.</p>
    <p>Overriding is when a sub-class redefines an operation using the same method name and the same type signature. Overridden methods have the same name, same method signature, and same return type.</p>

                <p>Take the example of writing a payroll application for a university to facilitate payroll processing of university staff. Suppose an <code>adjustSalary(int)</code> operation adjusts the salaries of all staff members. This operation will
                  be executed whenever the university initiates a salary adjustment for its staff. However, the adjustment formula is different for different staff categories, say admin and academic. Here is one possible way of designing the classes in
                  the <code>Payroll</code> system.</p>
                <tip-box>
                  <p>📦 Calling <code>adjustSalary()</code> method for each Staff type:</p>

                  <p></p>
                  <p>Here is the implementation of the <code>adjustSalary(int)</code> operation from the above design.</p>
                  <pre><code class="hljs java"><span class="hljs-class"><span class="hljs-keyword">class</span> <span class="hljs-title">Payroll1</span> </span>{

    }
}
</code></pre>
                </tip-box>
                <p>Note how processing is similar for the two staff types. It is as if the type of staff members is irrelevant to how they are processed inside this operation! If that is the case, can the staff type be &quot;abstracted away&quot; from this
                  method? Here is such an implementation of <code>adjustSalary(int)</code>:</p>
                <tip-box>
                  <pre><code class="hljs java"><span class="hljs-class"><span class="hljs-keyword">class</span> <span class="hljs-title">Payroll2</span> </span>{
    ArrayList&lt; Staff &gt; staff;

        <span class="hljs-keyword">for</span> (Staff s: staff) {
            s.adjustSalary(byPercent);
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>
                  <p>Notice the following:</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Only one data structure <code>ArrayList&lt; Staff &gt;</code>. It contains both <code>Admin</code> and <code>Academic</code> objects but treats them as <code>Staff</code> objects</li>
                    <li>Only one loop</li>
                    <li>Outcome of the <code>s.adjustSalary(byPercent)</code> method call depends on whether <code>s</code> is an <code>Academic</code> or <code>Admin</code> object</li>
                  </ul>
                </tip-box>
                <p>The above code is better in several ways:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>It is shorter.</li>
                  <li>It is simpler.</li>
                  <li>It is more flexible (this code will remain the same even if more staff types are added).</li>
                </ul>
                <p>This does not mean we are getting rid of the <code>Academic</code> and <code>Admin</code> classes completely and replacing them with a more general class called <code>Staff</code>. Rather, this part of the code “treats” both <code>Admin</code>                  and <code>Academic</code> objects as one type called <code>Staff</code>.</p>
                <p>For example, <code>ArrayList</code> staff contains both <code>Admin</code> and <code>Academic</code> objects although it treats all of them as <code>Staff</code> objects. However, when the <code>adjustSalary(int)</code> operation of these
                  objects is called, the resulting salary adjustment will be different for <code>Admin</code> objects and <code>Academic</code> objects. Therefore, different types of objects are treated as a single general type, but yet each type of object
                  exhibits a different kind of behavior. This is called <em>polymorphism</em> (literally, it means “ability to take many forms”). In this example, an object that is perceived as type <code>Staff</code> can be an <code>Admin</code> object
                  or an <code>Academic</code> object.</p>

    <p><strong>A <em>software requirement</em> specifies a need to be fulfilled by the software product.</strong></p>
    <p>A software project may be,</p>
    <ul>
      <li>a <em>brown-field</em> project i.e., develop a product to replace/update an existing software product</li>
      <li>a <em>green-field</em> project i.e., develop a totally new system with no precedent</li>
    </ul>
    <p>In either case, requirements need to be gathered, analyzed, specified, and managed.</p>

      <li><strong><em>Non-functional requirements</em> specify the constraints under which system is developed and operated.</strong></li>

          <li>Notes about project scope: e.g. the product is not required to handle the printing of reports.</li>
          <li>Any other noteworthy points: e.g. the game should not use images deemed offensive to those injured in real mine clearing activities.

  <div>
    <p><strong>Requirements can be prioritized based the importance and urgency</strong>, while keeping in mind the constraints of schedule, budget, staff resources, quality goals, and other constraints.</p>
    <p>A common approach is to group requirements into priority categories. Note that all such scales are subjective, and stakeholders define the meaning of each level in the scale for the project at hand.</p>
    <tip-box>
      <p>📦 An example scheme for categorizing requirements:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><code>Essential</code>: The product must have this requirement fulfilled or else it does not get user acceptance</li>
        <li><code>Typical</code>: Most similar systems have this feature although the product can survive without it.</li>
        <li><code>Novel</code>: New features that could differentiate this product from the rest.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>📦 Other schemes:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><code>High</code>, <code>Medium</code>, <code>Low</code></li>
        <li><code>Must-have</code>, <code>Nice-to-have</code>, <code>Unlikely-to-have</code></li>
        <li><code>Level 0</code>, <code>Level 1</code>, <code>Level 2</code>, ...</li>

        <p><strong>User story</strong>: User stories are short, simple descriptions of a feature told from the perspective of the person who desires the new capability, usually a user or customer of the system. <sub>[<a href="https://www.mountaingoatsoftware.com/agile/user-stories">Mike Cohn</a>]</sub></p>

    <p><strong>A common format</strong> for writing user stories is:</p>
    <tip-box type="definition">
      <div>
        <p><strong>User story format</strong>: <code>As a {user type/role} I can {function} so that {benefit}</code></p>

    <tip-box>
      <p>📦 Examples (from a <em>Learning Management System</em>):</p>
      <ol>
        <li>As a student, I can download files uploaded by lecturers, so that I can get my own copy of the files</li>
        <li>As a lecturer, I can create discussion forums, so that students can discuss things online</li>
        <li>As a tutor, I can print attendance sheets, so that I can take attendance during the class</li>
      </ol>
    </tip-box>
    <p></p>
    <p><strong>We can write user stories on</strong> index cards or sticky notes, and arrange on walls or tables, to facilitate planning and discussion. Alternatively, we can use a software (e.g., <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/about-project-boards/">GitHub Project Boards</a>,
      Trello, Google Docs, ...) to manage user stories digitally.</p>

      <p>Given their lightweight nature, <strong>user stories are quite handy for recording requirements during early requirements gathering</strong>.</p>
      <tip-box>
        <p>💡 Here are some tips for using user stories for early stages of requirement gathering:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Define the <em>target user</em>:</strong><br> Decide your target user's profile (e.g. a student, office worker, programmer, sales person) and work patterns (e.g. Does he work in groups or alone? Does he share his computer with others?).
            A clear understanding of the target user will help when deciding the importance of a user story. You can even give this user a name. <span class="dimmed"> e.g. Target user Jean is a university student studying in a non-IT field. She interacts with a lot of people due to her involvement in university clubs/societies. ...</span></li>
          <li><strong>Define the <em>problem scope</em>:</strong> Decide that exact problem you are going to solve for the target user. <span class="dimmed"> e.g. Help Jean keep track of all her school contacts</span></li>
          <li><strong>Don't be too hasty to discard 'unusual' user stories:</strong><br> Those might make your product unique and stand out from the rest, at least for the target users.</li>
          <li><strong>Don't go into too much details:</strong><br> For example, consider this user story: <code>As a user, I want to see a list of tasks that needs my attention most at the present time, so that I pay attention to them first.</code><br> When
            discussing this user story, don't worry about what tasks should be considered <em>needs my attention most at the present time</em>. Those details can be worked out later.</li>
          <li><strong>Don't be biased by preconceived product ideas:</strong><br> When you are at the stage of identifying user needs, clear your mind of ideas you have about what your end product will look like.</li>
          <li><strong>Don't discuss implementation details or whether you are actually going to implement it:</strong><br> When gathering requirements, your decision is whether the user's need is important enough for you to want to fulfil it. Implementation
            details can be discussed later. If a user story turns out to be too difficult to implement later, you can always omit it from the implementation plan.</li>

  </h4>
  <div>
    <p><strong>You can use actor generalization in use case diagrams</strong> using a symbol similar to that of UML notation for inheritance.</p>
    <tip-box>
      <p>📦 In this example, actor <code>Blogger</code> can do all the use cases the actor <code>Guest</code> can do, as a result of the actor generalization relationship given in the diagram.</p>
      <img src="/book/specifyingRequirements/useCases/usage/images/actorGeneralisation.png" height="250"></tip-box>
    <p>💡 Do not over-complicate use case diagrams by trying to include everything possible. A use case diagram is a brief summary of the use cases that is used as a starting point. Details of the use cases can be given in the use case descriptions.</p>
    <p><strong>Some include ‘System’ as an actor to indicate that something is done by the system itself without being initiated by a user or an external system.</strong></p>
    <tip-box>
      <p>📦 The diagram below can be used to indicate that the system generates daily reports at midnight.</p>
      <img src="/book/specifyingRequirements/useCases/usage/images/systemAsActor.jpg" height="200"></tip-box>
    <p>However, others argue that only use cases providing value to an external user/system should be shown in the use case diagram. For example, they argue that ‘view daily report’ should be the use case and <code>generate daily report</code> is not to
      be shown in the use case diagram because it is simply something the system has to do to support the <code>view daily report</code> use case.</p>
    <p>We recommend that you follow the latter view (i.e. not to use System as a user). Limit use cases for modeling behaviors that involve an external actor.</p>
    <p><strong>UML is not very specific about the text contents of a use case.</strong> Hence, there are many styles for writing use cases. For example, the steps can be written as a continuous paragraph. Use cases should be easy to read. Note that there
      is no strict rule about writing all details of all steps or a need to use all the elements of a use case.</p>
    <p><strong>There are some advantages of documenting system requirements as use cases:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Because they use a simple notation and plain English descriptions, they are easy for users to understand and give feedback.</li>
      <li>They decouple user intention from mechanism (note that use cases should not include UI-specific details), allowing the system designers more freedom to optimize how a functionality is provided to a user.</li>
      <li>Identifying all possible extensions encourages us to consider all situations that a software product might face during its operation.</li>
      <li>Separating typical scenarios from special cases encourages us to optimize the typical scenarios.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>One of the main disadvantages of use cases is that they are not good for capturing requirements that does not involve a user interacting with the system.</strong> Hence, they should not be used as the sole means to specify requirements.</p>

    <p><strong><em>Coupling</em> is a measure of the degree of <em>dependence</em></strong> between components, classes, methods, etc. Low coupling indicates that a component is less dependent on other components. <strong>High coupling (aka <em>tight</em> coupling or <em>strong</em> coupling) is discouraged</strong>      due to the following disadvantages:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Maintenance is harder</strong> because a change in one module could cause changes in other modules coupled to it (i.e. a ripple effect).</li>
      <li><strong>Integration is harder</strong> because multiple components coupled with each other have to be integrated at the same time.</li>
      <li><strong>Testing and reuse of the module is harder</strong> due to its dependence on other modules.</li>

      <li><strong>Subclass coupling</strong>: a class inherits from another class. Note that a child class is coupled to the parent class but not the other way around.</li>
      <li><strong>Temporal coupling</strong>: two actions are bundled together just because they happen to occur at the same time <span class="dimmed"> e.g. extracting a contiguous block of code as a method although the code block contains statements unrelated to each other</span></li>

    <p><strong>Higher cohesion is better.</strong> Disadvantages of low cohesion (aka <em>weak</em> cohesion):</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Impedes the understandability of modules as it is difficult to express module functionalities at a higher level.</li>
      <li>Lowers maintainability because a module can be modified due to unrelated causes <span class="dimmed"> (reason: the module contains code unrelated to each other)</span> or many many modules may need to be modified to achieve a small change in behavior
        <span class="dimmed"> (reason: because the code realated to that change is not localized to a single module)</span>.</li>
      <li>Lowers reusability of modules because they do not represent logical units of functionality.</li>

  </h4>
  <div>
    <p><strong>Cohesion can be present in many forms</strong>. Some examples:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Code related to a single concept is kept together, e.g. the Student component handles everything related to students.</li>
      <li>Code that is invoked close together in time is kept together, e.g. all code related to initializing the system is kept together.</li>
      <li>Code that manipulates the same data structure is kept together, e.g. the <code>GameArchive</code> component handles everything related to the storage and retrieval of game sessions.</li>
    </ul>
    <tip-box>
      <p>📦 Suppose a Payroll application contains a class that deals with writing data to the database. If the class include some code to show an error dialog to the user if the database is unreachable, that class is not cohesive because it seems to be
        interacting with the user as well as the database.</p>

        <p><strong><em>Model-driven development (MDD)</em>, also called <em>Model-driven engineering</em>, is an approach to software development that strives to exploits models as blueprints.</strong> MDD uses models as primary engineering artifacts when
          developing software. That is, the system is first created in the form of models. After that, the models are converted to code using code-generation techniques (usually, automated or semi-automated, but can even involve manual translation from
          model to code). MDD requires the use of a very expressive modeling notation (graphical or otherwise), often specific to a given problem domain. It also requires sophisticated tools to generate code from models and maintain the link between models
          and the code. One advantage of MDD is that the same model can be used to create software for different platforms and different languages. MDD has a lot of promise, but it is still an emerging technology</p>

    <p>An OO solution is basically a network of objects interacting with each other. Therefore, <strong>it is useful to be able to model how the relevant objects are 'networked' together</strong> inside a software <span class="dimmed"> i.e. how the objects are connect together</span>.</p>
    <tip-box>

    </blockquote>
    <p>Class diagrams can also be used to model objects in the
      <tooltip content="the relevant information that needs to be examined to understand a problem">problem domain</tooltip> (i.e. to model how objects actually interact in the real world, before emulating them in the solution). <strong>Class diagrams are used to model the problem domain are called <em>conceptual class diagrams</em> or <em>OO domain models (OODMs)</em>.</strong></p>
    <tip-box>
      <p>📦 OO domain model of a snakes and ladders game is given below.</p>
      <p>Description: Snakes and ladders game is played by two or more players using a board and a die. The board has 100 squares marked 1 to 100. Each player owns one piece. Players take turns to throw the die and advance their piece by the number of squares
        they earned from the die throw. The board has a number of snakes. If a player’s piece lands on a square with a snake head, the piece is automatically moved to the square containing the snake’s tail. Similarly, a piece can automatically move from
        a ladder foot to the ladder top. The player whose piece is the first to reach the 100th square wins.</p>
      <img src="/book/modeling/modelingStructures/objectOrientedDomainModels/images/diagram.png" height="420">
      <p></p>
      <p>The above OO domain model omits the ladder class for simplicity. It can be included in a similar fashion to the Snake class.</p>
    </tip-box>
    <p><strong>OODMs do not contain solution-specific classes</strong> (i.e. classes that are used in the solution domain but do not exist in the problem domain). For example, a class called DatabaseConnection could appear in a class diagram but not usually
      in an OO domain model because DatabaseConnection is something related to a software solution but not an entity in the problem domain.</p>
    <p><strong>OODMs represents the class <em>structure</em> of the problem domain</strong> and not their behavior, just like class diagrams. To show behavior, use other diagrams such as sequence diagrams.</p>
    <p><strong>OODM notation is similar to class diagram notation but typically omit methods and navigability.</strong></p>

      <p>What this means is that the CD player’s response to pushing the “eject CD” button depends on what it was doing at the time of the event. More generally, the CD player’s response to the event received depends on its internal state. Such a behavior
        is called a <em>state-dependent behavior</em>.</p>
    </tip-box>
    <p>Often, state-dependent behavior displayed by an object in a system is simple enough that it needs no extra attention; such a behavior can be as simple as a <em>conditional</em> behavior like <code>if x&gt;y, then x=x-y</code>. Occasionally, objects
      may exhibit state-dependent behavior that is complex enough such that it needs to be captured into a separate model. Such state-dependent behavior can be modelled using UML <em>state machine diagrams</em> (SMD for short, sometimes also called ‘state
      charts’, ‘state diagrams’ or ‘state machines’).</p>
    <p>An SMD views the life-cycle of an object as consisting of a finite number of states where each state displays a unique behavior pattern. An SMD captures information such as the states an object can be in, during its lifetime, and how the object responds
      to various events while in each state and how the object transits from one state to another. In contrast to sequence diagrams that capture object behavior one scenario at a time, SMDs capture the object’s behavior over its full life cycle.</p>

    <p>In the above design, <code>TextUi</code> does not access <code>Cell</code> objects directly. Instead, it gets values of type <code>CELL_APPEARANCE</code> from <code>Logic</code> to be displayed as a minefield to the player. Alternatively, each cell

    <p>The above is for the case when Actor <code>Player</code> interacts with the system using a text UI. Additional operations (if any) required for the GUI can be discovered similarly. Suppose <code>Logic</code> supports a <code>reset()</code> operation.

    <tip-box>
      <img src="/book/modeling/modelingASolution/intermediate/images/logicMinefieldReset.png" height="100"></tip-box>
    <p>Our current model assumes that the <code>Minefield</code> object has enough information (i.e. H, W, and mine locations) to create itself.</p>

      <p></p>

    <p>An alternative is to have a <code>ConfigGenerator</code> object that generates a string containing the minefield information as shown below.</p>

      <img src="/book/modeling/modelingASolution/intermediate/images/logicConfigGenerator.png" height="170">

    <p>How is <code>getGameState()</code> operation supported? Given below are two ways (there could be other ways):</p>
    <ol>
      <li><code>Minefield</code> class knows the state of the game at any time. <code>Logic</code> class retrieves it from the <code>Minefield</code> class as and when required.</li>
      <li><code>Logic</code> class maintains the state of the game at all times.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Here’s the SD for option 1.</p>
    <tip-box>
      <img src="/book/modeling/modelingASolution/intermediate/images/logicMinefieldGetGameState.png" height="180"></tip-box>
    <p>Here’s the SD for option 2. Here, assume that the game state is updated after every mark/clear action.</p>
    <tip-box>
      <img src="/book/modeling/modelingASolution/intermediate/images/logicMinefieldUpdateState.png" height="250"></tip-box>
    <p>It is now time to explore what happens inside the <code>Minefield</code> constructor? One way is to design it as follows.</p>
    <tip-box>
      <img src="/book/modeling/modelingASolution/intermediate/images/minefieldCellAlt.png" height="200"></tip-box>
    <p>Now let us assume that <code>Minesweeper</code> supports a ‘timing’ feature.</p>

    <tip-box>
      <p>💡 When designing components, it is not necessary to draw elaborate UML diagrams capturing all details of the design. They can be done as rough sketches. For example, draw sequence diagrams only when you are not sure which operations are required
        by each class, or when you want to verify that your class structure can indeed support the required operations.</p>

  <div>
    <p><strong>Context</strong></p>
    <p>A certain classes should have no more than just one instance (e.g. the main controller class of the system). These single instances are commonly known as <em>singletons</em>.</p>
    <p><strong>Problem</strong></p>
    <p>A normal class can be instantiated multiple times by invoking the constructor.</p>
    <p><strong>Solution</strong></p>
    <p>Make the constructor of the singleton class <code>private</code>, <span class="dimmed"> because a <code>public</code> constructor will allow others to instantiate the class at will</span>. Provide a <code>public</code> class-level method to access
      the <em>single instance</em>.</p>

    <pre><code class="hljs java"><span class="hljs-class"><span class="hljs-keyword">class</span> <span class="hljs-title">Logic</span> </span>{
    <span class="hljs-keyword">private</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">static</span> Logic theOne = <span class="hljs-keyword">null</span>;

    <span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">private</span> <span class="hljs-title">Logic</span><span class="hljs-params">()</span> </span>{

        <span class="hljs-keyword">if</span> (theOne == <span class="hljs-keyword">null</span>) {
            theOne = <span class="hljs-keyword">new</span> Logic();
        }
        <span class="hljs-keyword">return</span> theOne;
    }
}
</code></pre>
    <p>Notes:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The constructor is <code>private</code>, which prevents instantiation from outside the class.</li>
      <li>The single instance of the singleton class is maintained by a <code>private</code> class-level variable.</li>
      <li>Access to this object is provided by a <code>public</code> class-level operation <code>getInstance()</code> which instantiates a single copy of the singleton class when it is executed for the first time. Subsequent calls to this operation return
        the single instance of the class.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>If <code>Logic</code> was not a Singleton class, an object is created like this:</p>
    <pre><code class="hljs java">Logic m = <span class="hljs-keyword">new</span> Logic();
</code></pre>
    <p>But now, the <code>Logic</code> object needs to be accessed like this:</p>
    <pre><code class="hljs java">Logic m = Logic.getInstance();

      <li>effective in achieving its goal with minimal extra work</li>

    </ul>
    <p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>The singleton object acts like a global variable that increases coupling across the code base.</li>
      <li>In testing, it is difficult to replace Singleton objects with stubs (static methods cannot be overridden)</li>
      <li>In testing, singleton objects carry data from one test to another even when we want each test to be independent of the others.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Given there are some significant cons, it is recommended that you apply the Singleton pattern when, in addition to requiring only one instance of a class, there is a risk of creating multiple objects by mistake, and creating such multiple objects
      has real negative consequences.</p>

    <h2 id="abstraction-occurrence-pattern">Abstraction Occurrence Pattern</h2>
  </div>
  <h4 id="what-star-20">What <small><small>⭐️</small></small>
  </h4>
  <div>
    <p><strong>Context</strong></p>
    <p>There is a group of similar entities that appears to be ‘occurrences’ (or ‘copies’) of the same thing, sharing lots of common information, but also differing in significant ways.</p>
    <tip-box>
      <p>📦 In a library, there can be multiple copies of same book title. Each copy shares common information such as book title, author, ISBN etc. However, there are also significant differences like purchase date and barcode number (assumed to be unique
        for each copy of the book).</p>
      <p>Other examples:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Episodes of the same TV series</li>
        <li>Stock items of the same product model (e.g. TV sets of the same model).</li>
      </ul>
    </tip-box>
    <p><strong>Problem</strong></p>
    <p>Representing the objects mentioned previously as a single class would be problematic because it results in duplication of data which can lead to inconsistencies in data (if some of the duplicates are not updated consistently).</p>
    <tip-box>
      <p>📦 Take for example the problem of representing books in a library. Assume that there could be multiple copies of the same title, bearing the same ISBN number, but different serial numbers.</p>
      <img src="/book/designPatterns/abstractionOccurrence/what/images/book.png" height="200">
      <p></p>
      <p>The above solution requires common information to be duplicated by all instances. This will not only waste storage space, but also creates a consistency problem. Suppose that after creating several copies of the same title, the librarian realized
        that the author name was wrongly spelt. To correct this mistake, the system needs to go through every copy of the same title to make the correction. Also, if a new copy of the title is added later on, the librarian (or the system) has to make
        sure that all information entered is the same as the existing copies to avoid inconsistency.</p>
    </tip-box>
    <p><strong>Anti-pattern</strong></p>
    <tip-box>
      <p>📦 Refer to the same Library example given above.</p>
      <img src="/book/designPatterns/abstractionOccurrence/what/images/bookFriends.png" height="240">
      <p></p>
      <p>The design above segregates the common and unique information into a class hierarchy. Each book title is represented by a separate class with common data (i.e. Name, Author, ISBN) hard-coded in the class itself. This solution is problematic because
        each book title is represented as a class, resulting in thousands of classes (one for each title). Every time the library buys new books, the source code of the system will have to be updated with new classes.</p>
    </tip-box>
    <p><strong>Solution</strong></p>
    <p>Let a copy of an entity (e.g. a copy of a book)be represented by two objects instead of one, separating the common and unique information into two classes to avoid duplication.</p>
    <tip-box>
      <p>📦 Given below is how the pattern is applied to the Library example:</p>
      <img src="/book/designPatterns/abstractionOccurrence/what/images/bookTitleBookCopy.png" height="260">
      <p></p>

      <p></p>
    </tip-box>
    <p>The general solution:</p>
    <img src="/book/designPatterns/abstractionOccurrence/what/images/abstractionOccurrence.png" height="40">
    <p></p>
    <p>The <code>&lt;&lt; Abstraction &gt;&gt;</code> class should hold all common information, and the unique information should be kept by the <code>&lt;&lt; Occurrence &gt;&gt;</code> class. Note that ‘Abstraction’ and ‘Occurrence’ are not class names,
      but roles played by each class. Think of this diagram as a <em>meta-model</em> (i.e. a ‘model of a model’) of the <code>BookTitle-BookCopy</code> class diagram given above.</p>

    <p>It is preferable that some part of the code executes these commands without having to know each command type. <span class="dimmed"> e.g., there can be a <code>CommandQueue</code> object that is responsible for queuing commands and executing them without knowledge of what each command does.</span></p>
    <p><strong>Solution</strong></p>
    <p>The essential element of this pattern is to have a general <code>&lt;&lt; Command &gt;&gt;</code> object that can be passed around, stored, executed, etc without knowing the type of command (i.e. via polymorphism).</p>
    <p>Let us examine an example application of the pattern first:</p>
    <tip-box>
      <p>📦 In the example solution below, the <code>CommandCreator</code> creates <code>List</code>, <code>Sort</code>, and <code>Reset Command</code> objects and adds them to the <code>CommandQueue</code> object. The <code>CommandQueue</code> object treats
        them all as <code>Command</code> objects and performs the execute/undo operation on each of them without knowledge of the specific <code>Command</code> type. When executed, each <code>Command</code> object will access the <code>DataStore</code>        object to carry out its task. The <code>Command</code> class can also be an abstract class or an interface.</p>
      <img src="/book/designPatterns/command/what/images/commandCreator.png" height="150">
      <p></p>
    </tip-box>
    <p>The general form of the solution is as follows.</p>
    <img src="/book/designPatterns/command/what/images/clientInvoker.png" height="200">
    <p></p>
    <p>The <code>&lt;&lt; Client &gt;&gt;</code> creates a <code>&lt;&lt; ConcreteCommand &gt;&gt;</code> object, and passes it to the <code>&lt;&lt; Invoker &gt;&gt;</code>. The <code>&lt;&lt; Invoker &gt;&gt;</code> object treats all commands as a general
      <code>&lt;&lt; Command &gt;&gt;</code> type. <code>&lt;&lt; Invoker &gt;&gt;</code> issues a request by calling <code>execute()</code> on the command. If a command is undoable, <code>&lt;&lt; ConcreteCommand &gt;&gt;</code> will store the state
      for undoing the command prior to invoking <code>execute()</code>. In addition, the <code>&lt;&lt; ConcreteCommand &gt;&gt;</code> object may have to be linked to any <code>&lt;&lt; Receiver &gt;&gt;</code> of the command (
      <tooltip content="the object the command will operate on, in case different commands operate on different objects">?</tooltip>) before it is passed to the <code>&lt;&lt; Invoker &gt;&gt;</code>. Note that an application of the command pattern does not have to follow the structure given above.</p>

    <p><strong>Context</strong></p>
    <p>Most applications support storage/retrieval of information, displaying of information to the user (often via multiple UIs having different formats), and changing stored information based on external inputs.</p>
    <p><strong>Problem</strong></p>
    <p>To reduce coupling resulting from the interlinked nature of the features described above.</p>
    <p><strong>Solution</strong></p>
    <p>To decouple data, presentation, and control logic of an application by separating them into three different components: Model, View and Controller.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><em>View</em>: Displays data, interacts with the user, and pulls data from the model if necessary.</li>
      <li><em>Controller</em>: Detects UI events such as mouse clicks, button pushes and takes follow up action. Updates/changes the model/view when necessary.</li>
      <li><em>Model</em>: Stores and maintains data. Updates views if necessary.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The relationship between the components can be observed in the diagram below. Typically, the UI is the combination of view and controller.</p>
    <img src="/book/designPatterns/modelViewController/what/images/classDiagram.png" width="400">
    <p></p>
    <tip-box>
      <p>📦 Given below is a concrete example of MVC applied to a student management system. In this scenario, the user is retrieving data of one student.</p>
      <img src="/book/designPatterns/modelViewController/what/images/sequenceDiagram.png" width="500">
      <p></p>
      <p>In the diagram above, when the user clicks on a button using the UI, the ‘click’ event is caught and handled by the <code>UiController</code>.</p>
    </tip-box>
    <p>Note that in a simple UI where there’s only one view, Controller and View can be combined as one class.</p>
    <p>There are many variations of the MVC model used in different domains. For example, the one used in a desktop GUI could be different from the one used in a Web application.</p>

      <p>📦 Here is a scenario from the a student management system where the user is adding a new student to the system.</p>
      <img src="/book/designPatterns/observer/what/images/sequenceDiagram.png" height="330">
      <p></p>
      <p>Now, assume the system has two additional views used in parallel by different users:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><code>StudentListUi</code>: that accesses a list of students and</li>
        <li><code>StudentStatsUi</code>: that generates statistics of current students.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>When a student is added to the database using <code>NewStudentUi</code> shown above, both <code>StudentListUi</code> and <code>StudentStatsUi</code> should get updated automatically, as shown below.</p>
      <img src="/book/designPatterns/observer/what/images/studentListUI.png" height="180">
      <p></p>
      <p>However, the <code>StudentList</code> object has no knowledge about <code>StudentListUi</code> and <code>StudentStatsUi</code> (note the direction of the navigability) and has no way to inform those objects. This is an example of the type of problem
        addressed by the Observer pattern.</p>
    </tip-box>
    <p><strong>Context</strong></p>
    <p>An object (possibly, more than one) is interested to get notified when a change happens to another object. That is, some objects want to ‘observe’ another object.</p>
    <p><strong>Problem</strong></p>
    <p>The ‘observed’ object does not want to be coupled to objects that are ‘observing’ it.</p>
    <p><strong>Solution</strong></p>
    <p>Force the communication through an interface known to both parties.</p>

      <ol start="2">
        <li>Next, the two UIs indicate to the <code>StudentList</code> that they are interested in being updated whenever <code>StudentList</code> changes. This is also known as ‘subscribing for updates’.</li>
      </ol>
      <pre><code class="hljs java">studentList.addUi(listUi);
studentList.addUi(statusUi);
</code></pre>
      <p>Within the <code>addUi</code> operation of <code>StudentList</code>, all Observer objects subscribers are added to an internal data structure called <code>observerList</code>.</p>
      <pre><code class="hljs java"><span class="hljs-comment">//StudentList class</span>

    observerList.add(o);
}
</code></pre>
      <p>As such, whenever the data in <code>StudentList</code> changes (e.g. when a new student is added to the <code>StudentList</code>), all interested observers are updated by calling the <code>notifyUIs</code> operation.</p>
      <pre><code class="hljs java"><span class="hljs-comment">//StudentList class</span>
<span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">public</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">void</span> <span class="hljs-title">notifyUIs</span><span class="hljs-params">()</span> </span>{

    <span class="hljs-comment">//refresh UI by pulling data from StudentList</span>
}
</code></pre>
      <p>Note that <code>StudentList</code> is unaware of the exact nature of the two UIs but still manages to communicate with them via an intermediary.</p>
    </tip-box>
    <p>Here is the generic description of the observer pattern:</p>
    <img src="/book/designPatterns/observer/what/images/observableInterfaceDiagram.png" height="100">
    <p></p>
    <ul>
      <li><code>&lt;&lt; Observer &gt;&gt;</code> is an interface: any class that implements it can observe an <code>&lt;&lt; Observable &gt;&gt;</code>. Any number of <code>&lt;&lt; Observer &gt;&gt;</code> objects can observe (i.e. listen to changes of)
        the <code>&lt;&lt; Observable &gt;&gt;</code> object.</li>
      <li>The <code>&lt;&lt; Observable &gt;&gt;</code> maintains a list of <code>&lt;&lt; Observer &gt;&gt;</code> objects. <code>addObserver(Observer)</code> operation adds a new <code>&lt;&lt; Observer &gt;&gt;</code> to the list of <code>&lt;&lt; Observer &gt;&gt;s</code>.</li>
      <li>Whenever there is a change in the <code>&lt;&lt; Observable &gt;&gt;</code>, the <code>notifyObservers()</code> operation is called that will call the <code>update()</code> operation of all <code>&lt;&lt; Observer &gt;&gt;s</code> in the list.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>In a GUI application, how is the Controller notified when the “save” button is clicked? UI frameworks such as JavaFX has inbuilt support for the Observer pattern.</p>

  </h4>
  <div>
    <p><strong>Design patterns are usually embedded in a larger design and sometimes applied in combination with other design patterns.</strong></p>
    <tip-box>
      <p>📦 Let us look at a case study that shows how design patterns are used in the design of a class structure for a Stock Inventory System (SIS) for a shop. The shop sells appliances, and accessories for the appliances. SIS simply stores information
        about each item in the store.</p>
      <p><strong>Use Cases</strong>:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Create a new item</li>
        <li>View information about an item</li>
        <li>Modify information about an item</li>
        <li>View all available accessories for a given appliance</li>
        <li>List all items in the store</li>
      </ul>
      <p>SIS can be accessed using multiple terminals. Shop assistants use their own terminals to access SIS, while the shop manager’s terminal continuously displays a list of all items in store. In the future, it is expected that suppliers of items use
        their own applications to connect to SIS to get real-time information about current stock status. User authentication is not required for the current version, but may be required in the future.</p>
      <p>A step by step explanation of the design is given below. Note that this is one out of many possible designs. Design patterns are also applied where appropriate.</p>
      <p>A <code>StockItem</code> can be an Appliance or an Accessory.</p>
      <img src="/book/designPatterns/more/combiningDesignPatterns/images/stockItem.png" height="100">
      <p></p>
      <p>To track that each <code>Accessory</code> is associated with the correct <code>Appliance</code>, consider the following alternative class structures.</p>
      <img src="/book/designPatterns/more/combiningDesignPatterns/images/alternativeOne.png" height="120">
      <p></p>
      <p>The third one seems more appropriate (the second one is suitable if accessories can have accessories). Next, consider between keeping a list of <code>Appliances</code>, and a list of <code>StockItems</code>. Which is more appropriate?</p>
      <img src="/book/designPatterns/more/combiningDesignPatterns/images/alternativeTwo.png" height="100">
      <p></p>
      <p>The latter seems more suitable because it can handle both appliances and accessories the same way. Next, an abstraction occurrence pattern is applied to keep track of <code>StockItems</code>.</p>
      <img src="/book/designPatterns/more/combiningDesignPatterns/images/alternativeThree.png" height="100">
      <p></p>
      <p>Note the inclusion of navigabilities. Here’s a sample object diagram based on the class model created thus far.</p>
      <img src="/book/designPatterns/more/combiningDesignPatterns/images/stockItemListObjectDiagram.png" height="150">
      <p></p>
      <p>Next, apply the façade pattern to shield the SIS internals from the UI.</p>
      <img src="/book/designPatterns/more/combiningDesignPatterns/images/withFacade.png" height="200">
      <p></p>
      <p>As UI consists of multiple views, the MVC pattern is applied here.</p>
      <img src="/book/designPatterns/more/combiningDesignPatterns/images/withMVC.png" height="270">
      <p></p>
      <p>Some views need to be updated when the data change; apply the Observer pattern here.</p>
      <img src="/book/designPatterns/more/combiningDesignPatterns/images/withObserver.png" height="270">
      <p></p>
      <p>In addition, the Singleton pattern can be applied to the façade class.</p>

      <p>📦 Someone can say 'apply Observer pattern here' instead of having to describe the mechanics of the solution in detail.</p>
    </tip-box>
    <p><strong>Knowing more patterns is a way to become more ‘experienced’.</strong> Aim to learn at least the context and the problem of patterns <span class="dimmed"> so that when you encounter those problems you know where to look for a solution</span>.</p>
    <p><strong>Some patterns are domain-specific</strong> <span class="dimmed"> e.g. patterns for distributed applications</span>, <strong>some are created in-house</strong> <span class="dimmed"> e.g. patterns in the company/project</span> and <strong>some can be self-created</strong>      <span class="dimmed"> e.g. from past experience</span>.</p>
    <p><strong>Be careful not to overuse patterns.</strong> Do not throw patterns at a problem at every opportunity. Patterns come with overhead such as adding more classes or increasing the levels of abstraction. Use them only when they are needed. Before
      applying a pattern, make sure that:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>there is substantial improvement in the design, not just superficial.</li>
      <li>the associated tradeoffs are carefully considered. There are times when a design pattern is not appropriate (or an overkill).</li>

  <div>
    <p>The notion of capturing design ideas as &quot;patterns&quot; is usually attributed to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Alexander">Christopher Alexander</a>. He is a building architect noted for his theories about design. His book
      <em>Timeless way of building</em> talks about &quot;design patterns&quot; for constructing buildings.</p>
    <p>Here is a sample pattern from that book:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>When a room has a window with a view, the window becomes a focal point: people are attracted to the window and want to look through it. The furniture in the room creates a second focal point: everyone is attracted toward whatever point the furniture
        aims them at (usually the center of the room or a TV). This makes people feel uncomfortable. They want to look out the window, and toward the other focus at the same time. If you rearrange the furniture, so that its focal point becomes the window,
        then everyone will suddenly notice that the room is much more “comfortable”</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Apparently, patterns and anti-patterns are found in the field of building architecture. This is because they are general concepts applicable to any domain, not just software design. In software engineering, there are many general types of patterns:
      Analysis patterns, Design patterns, Testing patterns, Architectural patterns, Project management patterns, and so on.</p>
    <p>In fact, the abstraction occurrence pattern is more of an analysis pattern than a design pattern, while MVC is more of an architectural pattern.</p>
    <p>New patterns can be created too. If a common problem needs to be solved frequently that leads to a non-obvious and better solution, it can be formulated as a pattern so that it can be reused by others. However, don’t reinvent the wheel; the pattern
      might already exist.</p>

      <li>A compiler and/or an interpreter (together with other build automation support) that facilitates the compilation/linking/running/deployment of a program.</li>
      <li>A debugger that allows the developer to execute the program one step at a time to observe the run-time behavior in order to locate bugs.</li>
      <li>Other tools that aid various aspects of coding e.g. support for automated testing, drag-and-drop construction of UI components, version management support, simulation of the target runtime platform, and modeling support.</li>

    <p><strong><em>Debugging</em> is the process of discovering defects in the program.</strong> Here are some approaches to debugging:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>👎 <strong>By inserting temporary print statements</strong>: This is an ad-hoc approach in which print statements are inserted in the program to print information relevant to debugging, such as variable values. e.g. <code>Exiting process() method, x is 5.347</code>.
          This approach is not recommended due to these reasons.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Incurs extra effort when inserting and removing the print statements.</li>
          <li>Unnecessary program modifications increases the risk of introducing errors into the program.</li>
          <li>These print statements, if not promptly removed, may even appear unexpectedly in the production version.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>👎 <strong>By manually tracing through the code</strong>: Otherwise known as ‘eye-balling’, this approach doesn't have the cons of the previous approach, but it too is not recommended (other than as a 'quick try') due to these reasons:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>It is difficult, time consuming, and error-prone technique.</li>
          <li>If you didn't spot the error while writing code, you might not spot the error when reading code too.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>👍 <strong>Using a debugger</strong>: A debugger tool allows you to pause the execution, then step through one statement at a time while examining the internal state if necessary. Most IDEs come with an inbuilt debugger. <strong>This is the recommended approach for debugging</strong>.</p>
      </li>

    </blockquote>
    <p><strong>Among various dimensions of code quality, such as run-time efficiency, security, and robustness, one of the most important is understandability.</strong> This is because in any non-trivial software project, code needs to be read, understood,
      and modified by other developers later on. Even if we do not intend to pass the code to someone else, code quality is still important because we all become 'strangers' to our own code someday.</p>

    <p>As the old adage goes, <strong>&quot;keep it simple, stupid” (KISS).  Do not try to write ‘clever’ code.</strong> For example, do not dismiss the brute-force yet simple solution in favor of a complicated one because of some ‘supposed benefits’ such
      as 'better reusability' unless you have a strong justification.</p>

  </h4>
  <div>
    <p><strong>Optimizing code prematurely has several drawbacks</strong>:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>We may not know which parts are the real performance bottlenecks</strong>. This is especially the case when the code undergoes transformations (e.g. compiling, minifying, transpiling, etc.) before it becomes an executable. Ideally, you should
        use a profiler tool to identify the actual bottlenecks of the code first, and optimize only those parts.</li>
      <li><strong>Optimizing can complicate the code</strong>, affecting correctness and understandability</li>
      <li><strong>Hand-optimized code can be harder for the compiler to optimize</strong> (the simpler the code, the easier for the compiler to optimize it). In many cases a compiler can do a better job of optimizing the runtime code if you don't get in the
        way by trying to hand-optimize the source code.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>A popular saying in the industry is <strong><em>make it work, make it right, make it fast</em></strong> which means in most cases getting the code to perform correctly should take priority over optimizing it. If the code doesn't work correctly, it
      has no value on matter how fast/efficient it it.</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>Premature optimization is the root of all evil in programming. <sub>--<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Knuth">Donald Knuth</a></sub></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Note that <strong>there are cases where optimizing takes priority over other things</strong> <span class="dimmed">e.g. when writing code for resource-constrained environments</span>. This guideline simply a caution that you should optimize only when
      it is really needed.</p>

                  <p><strong>Abstraction</strong> is a technique for dealing with complexity. It works by establishing a level of complexity (or an aspect) we are interested in, and suppressing the more complex details below that level (or irrelevant to
                    that aspect).</p>
                </div>
              </tip-box>
              <p>Most programs are written to solve complex problems involving large amounts of intricate details. It is impossible to deal with all these details at the same time. The guiding principle of abstraction stipulates that we capture only details
                that are relevant to the current perspective or the task at hand.</p>
              <p><strong>Ignoring lower level data items and thinking in terms of bigger entities is called <em>data abstraction</em>.</strong></p>
              <tip-box>
                <p>📦 Within a certain software component, we might deal with a <em>user</em> data type, while ignoring the details contained in the user data item such as <em>name</em>, and <em>date of birth</em>. These details have been ‘abstracted away’
                  as they do not affect the task of that software component.</p>
              </tip-box>
              <p><strong><em>Control abstraction</em> abstracts away details of the actual control flow to focus on tasks at a simplified level.</strong></p>
              <tip-box>
                <p>📦 <code>print(“Hello”)</code> is an abstraction of the actual output mechanism within the computer.</p>
              </tip-box>
              <p><strong>Abstraction can be applied repeatedly to obtain progressively <em>higher levels of abstractions</em>.</strong></p>
              <tip-box>
                <p>📦 An example of different levels of data abstraction: a <code>File</code> is a data item that is at a higher level than an array and an array is at a higher level than a bit.</p>

  <div>
    <p>The happy path (i.e. the execution path taken when everything goes well) should be clear and prominent in your code. Restructure the code to make the happy path unindented as much as possible. It is the ‘unusual’ cases that should be indented. Someone
      reading the code should not get distracted by alternative paths taken when error conditions happen. One technique that could help in this regard is the use of <a href="http://wiki.c2.com/?GuardClause">guard clauses</a>.</p>

    <p><strong>One essential way to improve code quality is to follow a consistent style. That is why software engineers follow a strict coding standard (aka <em>style guide</em>).</strong></p>
    <p><strong>The aim of a coding standard is to make the entire code base look like it was written by one person</strong>. A coding standard is usually specific to a programming language and specifies guidelines such as the location of opening and closing
      braces, indentation styles and naming styles (e.g. whether to use Hungarian style, Pascal casing, Camel casing, etc.). It is important that the whole team/company use the same coding standard and that standard is not generally inconsistent with
      typical industry practices. <span class="dimmed">If a company's coding standards is very different from what is used typically in the industry, new recruits will take longer to get used to the company's coding style.</span></p>

  </h4>
  <div>
    <p>Always include a default branch in <code>case</code> statements.</p>
    <p>Furthermore, use it for the intended default action and not just to execute the last option. If there is no default action, you can use the 'default' branch to detect errors (i.e. if execution reached the <code>default</code> branch, throw an exception).
      This also applies to the final <code>else</code> of an <code>if-else</code> construct. That is, the final <code>else</code> should mean 'everything else', and not the final option. Do not use <code>else</code> when an <code>if</code> condition can
      be explicitly specified, unless there is absolutely no other possibility.</p>

  </h4>
  <div>
    <p><strong>Minimize global variables</strong>. Global variables may be the most convenient way to pass information around, but they do create implicit links between code segments that use the global variable. Avoid them as much as possible.</p>
    <p><strong>Define variables in the least possible scope</strong>. For example, if the variable is used only within the <code>if</code> block of the conditional statement, it should be declared inside that <code>if</code> block.</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><strong>The most powerful technique for minimizing the scope of a local variable is to declare it where it is first used.</strong> <sub>-- <em>Effective Java</em>, by Joshua Bloch</sub></p>

  <div>
    <p>The first version of the code you write may not be of production quality. It is OK to first concentrate on making the code work, rather than worry over the quality of the code, as long as you improve the quality later. This process of <strong>improving a program's internal structure in small steps without modifying its external behavior is called <em>refactoring</em>.</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Refactoring is not rewriting</strong>: Discarding poorly-written code entirely and re-writing it from scratch is not refactoring because refactoring needs to be done in small steps.</li>
      <li><strong>Refactoring is not bug fixing</strong>: By definition, refactoring is different from bug fixing or any other modifications that alter the external behavior (e.g. adding a feature) of the component in concern.</li>
    </ul>
    <tip-box>
      <p>💡 Improving code structure can have many secondary benefits: e.g.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>hidden bugs become easier to spot</li>
        <li>improve performance (sometimes, simpler code runs faster than complex code because simpler code is easier for the compiler to optimize).</li>

    <p>We know that it is important to refactor frequently so as to avoid the accumulation of ‘messy’ code which might get out of control. But how much refactoring is too much refactoring? <strong>It is too much refactoring when the benefits no longer justify the cost.</strong>      The costs and the benefits depend on the context. That is why some refactorings are ‘opposites’ of each other (e.g. <a href="https://refactoring.com/catalog/extractMethod.html"><em>extract method</em></a> vs <a href="https://refactoring.com/catalog/inlineMethod.html"><em>inline method</em></a>).</p>

    <p>Here are some tips on writing effective documentation.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Use plenty of diagrams</strong>: It is not enough to explain something in words; complement it with visual illustrations (e.g. a UML diagram).</li>
      <li><strong>Use plenty of examples</strong>: When explaining algorithms, show a running example to illustrate each step of the algorithm, in parallel to worded explanations.</li>
      <li><strong>Use simple and direct explanations</strong>: Convoluted explanations and fancy words will annoy readers. Avoid long sentences.</li>
      <li><strong>Get rid of statements that do not add value</strong>: For example, 'We made sure our system works perfectly' (who didn't?), 'Component X has its own responsibilities' (of course it has!).</li>
      <li><strong>It is not a good idea to have separate sections for each type of artifact</strong>, such as 'use cases', 'sequence diagrams', 'activity diagrams', etc. Such a structure, coupled with the indiscriminate inclusion of diagrams without justifying
        their need, indicates a failure to understand the purpose of documentation. Include diagrams when they are needed to explain something. If you want to provide additional diagrams for completeness' sake, include them in the appendix as a reference.</li>

      <li>Writing and maintaining developer documents is an overhead. You should try to minimize that overhead.</li>

    <p>Anything that is already clear in the code need not be described in words. Instead, <strong>focus on providing higher level information that is not readily visible in the code or comments</strong>.</p>
    <p>Refrain from duplicating chunks or text. When describing several similar algorithms/designs/APIs, etc., do not simply duplicate large chunks of text. Instead, <strong>describe the similarity in one place and emphasize only the differences in other places.</strong>      It is very annoying to see pages and pages of similar text without any indication as to how they differ from each other.</p>

    <p><strong><em>Logging</em> is the deliberate recording of certain information during a program execution for future reference.</strong> Logs are typically written to a log file but it is also possible to log information in other ways <span class="dimmed"> e.g. into a database or a remote server</span>.</p>
    <p><strong><em>Logging</em> can be useful for troubleshooting problems</strong>. A good logging system records some system information regularly. When bad things happen to a system <span class="dimmed"> e.g. an unanticipated failure</span>, their associated
      log files may provide indications of what went wrong and action can then be taken to prevent it from happening again.</p>

    <p>Consider two classes, <code>Account</code> and <code>Guarantor</code>, with an association as shown in the following diagram:</p>
    <tip-box>
      <p>Example:</p>
      <img src="/book/errorHandling/defensiveProgramming/compulsoryAssociations/images/accountGuarantor.png" height="50">
      <p></p>
      <p>Here, the association is compulsory i.e. an <code>Account</code> object should always be linked to a <code>Guarantor</code>. One way to implement this is to simply use a reference variable, like this:</p>
      <pre><code class="hljs java"><span class="hljs-class"><span class="hljs-keyword">class</span> <span class="hljs-title">Account</span> </span>{
    Guarantor guarantor;

      <p>However, what if someone else used the <code>Account</code> class like this?</p>
      <pre><code class="hljs java">Account a = <span class="hljs-keyword">new</span> Account();
a.setGuarantor(<span class="hljs-keyword">null</span>);
</code></pre>
      <p>This results in an <code>Account</code> without a <code>Guarantor</code>! In a real banking system, this could have serious consequences! The code here did not try to prevent such a thing from happening. We can make the code more defensive by proactively

</code></pre>
    <p>Option 1 forces us to keep a <code>Mine</code> without a <code>MinedCell</code> (until the <code>MinedCell</code> is created).</p>
    <p>Option 2:</p>
    <pre><code class="hljs java"><span class="hljs-class"><span class="hljs-keyword">class</span> <span class="hljs-title">MinedCell</span> </span>{

    <p>Now James' girlfriend is Jean, while Jean's boyfriend is not James. This situation results as the code was not defensive enough to stop this &quot;love triangle&quot;. In such a situation, we say that <em>the referential integrity has been violated</em>.

  <div>
    <p><strong><tooltip content="term was coined by Bertrand Meyer">Design by contract (DbC)</tooltip> is an approach for designing software that requires defining formal, precise and verifiable interface specifications for software components.</strong></p>
    <p>Suppose an operation is implemented with the behavior specified precisely in the API (preconditions, post conditions, exceptions etc.). When following the defensive approach, the code should first check if the preconditions have been met. Typically,
      exceptions are thrown if preconditions are violated. In contrast, the <em>Design-by-Contract (DbC)</em> approach to coding assumes that it is the responsibility of the caller to ensure all preconditions are met. The operation will honor the contract
      only if the preconditions have been met. If any of them have not been met, the behavior of the operation is &quot;unspecified&quot;.</p>
    <p>Languages such as Eiffel have native support for DbC. For example, preconditions of an operation can be specified in Eiffel and the language runtime will check precondition violations without the need to do it explicitly in the code. To follow the
      DbC approach in languages such as Java and C++ where there is no built-in DbC support, assertions can be used to confirm pre-conditions.</p>

    <p><strong>Based on the order in which components are integrated, incremental integration can be done in three ways.</strong></p>
    <p><strong><em>Top-down</em> integration: higher-level components are integrated before bringing in the lower-level components.</strong> One advantage of this approach is that higher-level problems can be discovered early. One disadvantage is that this
      requires the use of
      <trigger for="pop:topdown-stub">stubs</trigger> in place of lower level components until the real lower-level components are integrated to the system. Otherwise, higher-level components cannot function as they depend on lower level ones.</p>

          <p><strong>Stub</strong>: A stub has the same interface as the component it replaces, but its implementation is so simple that it is unlikely to have any bugs. It mimics the responses of the component, but only for the a limited set of predetermined
            inputs. That is, it does not know how to respond to any other inputs. Typically, these mimicked responses are hard-coded in the stub rather than computed or retrieved from elsewhere, e.g. from a database.</p>

    <p><strong><em>Bottom-up</em> integration: the reverse of top-down integration.</strong> Note that when integrating lower level components,
      <tooltip content="additional code written to provide inputs to a component via an API">drivers</tooltip> may be needed to test the integrated components <span class="dimmed"> because the UI may not be integrated yet</span>, just like top-down integration needs stubs.</p>

    <p><strong>Build automation tools automate the steps of the build process, usually by means of build scripts.</strong></p>
    <p>In a non-trivial project, building a product from source code can be a complex multi-step process. <span class="dimmed"> For example, it can include steps such as to pull code from the revision control system, compile, link, run automated tests, automatically update release documents (e.g. build number), package into a distributable, push to repo, deploy to a server, delete temporary files created during building/testing, email developers of the new build, and so on. Furthermore, this build process can be done ‘on demand’, it can be scheduled (e.g. every day at midnight) or it can be triggered by various events (e.g. triggered by a code push to the revision control system).</span></p>
    <p>Some of these build steps such as to compile, link and package are already automated in most modern IDEs. <span class="dimmed"> For example, several steps happen automatically when the ‘build’ button of the IDE is clicked. Some IDEs even allow customization to this build process to some extent.</span></p>
    <p>However, most big projects use specialized build tools to automate complex build processes.</p>
    <tip-box>
      <p>📦 Some popular build tools relevant to Java developers:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="https://gradle.org/">Gradle</a></li>
        <li><a href="http://maven.apache.org/">Maven</a></li>
        <li><a href="http://ant.apache.org/">Apache Ant</a></li>
        <li><a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/make/">GNU Make</a></li>
      </ul>
      <p>📦 <span class="dimmed">Some other build tools : Grunt (JavaScript), Rake (Ruby)</span></p>
    </tip-box>
    <p><strong>Some build tools also serve as <em>dependency management tools</em></strong>. Modern software projects often depend on third party libraries that evolve constantly. That means developers need to download the correct version of the required
      libraries and update them regularly. Therefore, dependency management is an important part of build automation. Dependency Management tools can automate that aspect of a project.</p>
    <tip-box>
      <p>📦 Maven and Gradle, in addition to managing the build process, can play the role of dependency management tools too.</p>

    <p>Reuse is a major theme in software engineering practices. <strong>By reusing tried-and-tested components, the robustness of a new software system can be enhanced while reducing the manpower and time requirement.</strong> Reusable components come in
      many forms; it can be reusing a piece of code, a subsystem, or a whole software.</p>

  <div>
    <p>While you may be tempted to use many libraries/frameworks/platform that seem to crop up on a regular basis and promise to bring great benefits, note that <strong>there are costs associated with reuse</strong>. Here are some:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The reused code <strong>may be an overkill</strong> (think <em>using a sledgehammer to crack a nut</em>) increasing the size of, or/and degrading the performance of, your software.</li>
      <li>The reused software <strong>may not be mature/stable enough</strong> to be used in an important product. That means the software can change drastically and rapidly, possibly in ways that break your software.</li>
      <li>Non-mature software has the <strong>risk of dying off</strong> as fast as they emerged, leaving you with a dependency that is no longer maintained.</li>
      <li>The license of the reused software (or its dependencies) <strong>restrict how you can use/develop your software</strong>.</li>
      <li>The reused software <strong>might have bugs, missing features, or security vulnerabilities</strong> that are important to your product but not so important to the maintainers of that software, which means those flaws will not get fixed as fast as
        you need them to.</li>
      <li><strong>Malicious code can sneak into your product</strong> via compromised dependencies.</li>

  <div>
    <p><strong>An <em>Application Programming Interface (API)</em> specifies the interface through which other programs can interact with a software component.</strong> It is a contract between the component and its clients.</p>
    <tip-box>
      <p>📦 A class has an API (e.g., <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/String.html">API of the Java <code>String</code> class</a>, <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#text-sequence-type-str">API of the Python <code>str</code> class</a>)
        which is a collection of public methods that you can invoke to make use of the class.</p>
      <p>📦 The <a href="https://developer.github.com/v3/">GitHub API</a> is a collection of Web request formats GitHub server accepts and the corresponding responses. We can write a program that interacts with GitHub through that API.</p>
    </tip-box>
    <p>When developing large systems, if you define the API of each components early, the development team can develop the components in parallel <span class="dimmed"> because the future behavior of the other components are now more predictable</span>.</p>
  </div>
  <h4 id="designing-apis-star">Designing APIs <small><small>⭐️</small></small>
  </h4>
  <div>
    <p>An API should be well-designed (i.e. should cater for the needs of its users) and well-documented.</p>
    <p>When we write software consisting of multiple components, we need to define the API of each component.</p>
    <p>One approach is to let the API emerge and evolve over time as we write code.</p>
    <p>Another approach is to define the API up-front. Doing so allows us to develop the components in parallel.</p>
    <p>We can use UML <em>sequence diagrams</em> to analyze the required interactions between components in order to discover the required API. Given below is an example.</p>
    <tip-box>
      <p>Example:</p>
      <img src="/book/reuse/apis/designingAPIs/images/textLogic.png" height="500">
      <p></p>
      <p>As we analyze the interactions between components using sequence diagrams, we discover the API of those components. For example, the diagram above tells us that the MSLogic component API should have the methods:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><code>new()</code></li>
        <li><code>getWidth:int</code></li>
        <li><code>getHeight():int</code></li>
        <li><code>getRemainingMineCount():int</code></li>
      </ul>
      <p>More details can be included to increase the precision of the method definitions before coding. Such precision is important to avoid misunderstandings between the developer of the class and developers of other classes that interact with this class.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Operation</strong>: <em>newGame(): void</em></li>
        <li><strong>Description</strong>: Generates a new <em>WxH</em> minefield with <em>M</em> mines. Any existing minefield will be overwritten.</li>
        <li><strong>Preconditions</strong>: None</li>
        <li><strong>Postconditions</strong>: A new minefield is created. Game state is READY.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Preconditions are the conditions that must be true before calling this operation. Postconditions describe the system after the operation is complete. Note that post conditions do not say what happens during the operation. Here is another example:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Operation</strong>: <em>clearCellAt(int x, int y): void</em></li>
        <li><strong>Description</strong>: Records the cell at x,y as cleared.</li>
        <li><strong>Parameters</strong>: x, y coordinates of the cell</li>
        <li><strong>Preconditions</strong>: game state is READY or IN_PLAY. x and y are in 0..(H-1) and 0..(W-1), respectively.</li>
        <li><strong>Postconditions</strong>: Cell at x,y changes state to ZERO, ONE, TWO, THREE, …, EIGHT, or INCORRECTLY_CLEARED. Game state changes to IN_PLAY, WON or LOST as appropriate.</li>

      the power company manages the power plant, while the consumers pay them only for the electricity used. The cloud computing model optimizes hardware and software utilization and reduces the cost to consumers. Furthermore, users can scale up/down

    <p>Cloud computing can deliver computing services at three levels:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Infrastructure as a service (IaaS) delivers computer infrastructure as a service.</strong> For example, a user can deploy virtual servers on the cloud instead of buying physical hardware and installing server software on them. Another
          example would be a customer using storage space on the cloud for off-site storage of data. <span class="dimmed"> Rackspace is an example of an IaaS cloud provider. Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) is another one.</span></p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Platform as a service (PaaS) provides a platform on which developers can build applications.</strong> Developers do not have to worry about infrastructure issues such as deploying servers or load balancing as is required when using IaaS.
          Those aspects are automatically taken care of by the platform. The price to pay is reduced flexibility; applications written on PaaS are limited to facilities provided by the platform. <span class="dimmed"> A PaaS example is the Google App Engine where developers can build applications using Java, Python, PHP, or Go whereas Amazon EC2 allows users to deploy application written in any language on their virtual servers.</span></p>

        <p><strong>Static analysis</strong>: Static analysis is the analysis of code without actually executing the code.</p>
      </div>
    </tip-box>
    <p>Static analysis of code can find useful information such unused variables, unhandled exceptions, style errors, and statistics. Most modern IDEs come with some inbuilt static analysis capabilities. For example, an IDE can highlight unused variables
      as you type the code into the editor.</p>
    <p>Higher-end static analyzer tools can perform for more complex analysis such as locating potential bugs, memory leaks, inefficient code structures etc.</p>
    <tip-box>
      <p>📦 Some example static analyzer for Java:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="http://checkstyle.sourceforge.net/">CheckStyle</a></li>
        <li><a href="http://findbugs.sourceforge.net/">PMD</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://pmd.github.io/">FindBugs</a></li>
      </ul>
    </tip-box>
    <p><em>Linters</em> are a subset of static analyzers that specifically aim to locate areas where the code can be made 'cleaner'.</p>

      <li><strong>Formal verification can be used to prove the absence of errors</strong>. In contrast, testing can only prove the presence of error, not their absence.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Disadvantages:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>It only proves the compliance with the specification, but not the actual utility of the software.</li>
      <li>It requires highly specialized notations and knowledge which makes it an expensive technique to administer. Therefore, <strong>formal verifications are more commonly used in safety-critical software such as flight control systems</strong>.</li>

    <p><strong>When testing, we execute a set of <em>test cases</em>.</strong> A test case specifies how to perform a test. At a minimum, it specifies the input to the <em>software under test (SUT)</em> and the expected behavior.</p>
    <tip-box>
      <p>📦 Example: A minimal test case for testing a browser:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Input</strong> – Start the browser using a blank page (vertical scrollbar disabled). Then, load <code>longfile.html</code> located in the <code>test data</code> folder.</li>
        <li><strong>Expected behavior</strong> – The scrollbar should be automatically enabled upon loading <code>longfile.html</code>.</li>
      </ul>
    </tip-box>
    <p><strong>Test cases can be determined based on the specification, reviewing similar existing systems, or comparing to the past behavior of the SUT.</strong></p>
    <panel header="%%Other details a test case can contain :two:%%" type="seamless">
      <p>A more elaborate test case can have other details such as those given below.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>A unique identifier : <span class="dimmed">e.g. TC0034-a</span></li>
        <li>A descriptive name: <span class="dimmed">e.g. vertical scrollbar activation for long web pages</span></li>
        <li>Objectives: <span class="dimmed">e.g. to check whether the vertical scrollbar is correctly activated when a long web page is loaded to the browser</span></li>

      </ul>
      <p></p>
    </panel>
    <p></p>
    <p>For each test case we do the following:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Feed the input to the SUT</li>
      <li>Observe the actual output</li>
      <li>Compare actual output with the expected output</li>
    </ol>
    <p><strong>A test case <em>failure</em> is a mismatch between the expected behavior and the actual behavior. A failure is caused by a <em>defect</em> (or a bug).</strong></p>
    <tip-box>
      <p>📦 Example: In the browser example above, a test case failure is implied if the scrollbar remains disabled after loading <code>longfile.html</code>. The defect/bug causing that failure could be an uninitialized variable.</p>

      <p>Here is another definition of testing:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>Software testing consists of the <em>dynamic</em> verification that a program provides <em>expected</em> behaviors on a <em>finite</em> set of test cases, suitably <em>selected</em> from the usually infinite execution domain. <sub>-– source: <a href="https://www.computer.org/web/swebok/v3">Software Engineering Book of Knowledge V3</a></sub></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>Some things to note (indicated by keywords in the above definition):</p>
      <ul>
        <li><em>Dynamic</em>: Testing involves executing the software. It is not by examining the code statically.</li>
        <li><em>Finite</em>: In most non-trivial cases there are potentially infinite test scenarios but resource constraints dictate that we can test only a finite number of scenarios.</li>
        <li><em>Selected</em>: In most cases it is not possible to test all scenarios. That means we need to select what scenarios to test.</li>
        <li><em>Expected</em>: Testing requires some knowledge of how the software is expected to behave.</li>

</code></pre>
      <p>Normally, you would use the <code>Logic</code> class as follows (not how the <code>Logic</code> object depends on a <code>DatabaseStorage</code> object to perform the <code>getName()</code> operation):</p>
      <pre><code class="hljs java">Logic logic = <span class="hljs-keyword">new</span> Logic(<span class="hljs-keyword">new</span> DatabaseStorage());
String name = logic.getName(<span class="hljs-number">23</span>);

      <p>You can test it like this:</p>

    assertEquals(<span class="hljs-string">"Name: John"</span>, logic.getName(<span class="hljs-number">5</span>));
}
</code></pre>
      <p>However, this <code>logic</code> object being tested is making use of a <code>DataBaseStorage</code> object which means a bug in the <code>DatabaseStorage</code> class can affect the test. Therefore, this test is not testing <code>Logic</code> <em>in isolation from its dependencies</em>        and hence it is not a pure unit test.</p>
      <p>Here is a stub class you can use in place of <code>DatabaseStorage</code>:</p>
      <pre><code class="hljs java"><span class="hljs-class"><span class="hljs-keyword">class</span> <span class="hljs-title">StorageStub</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">implements</span> <span class="hljs-title">Storage</span> </span>{

}
</code></pre>
      <p>Note how the stub has the same interface as the real dependency, is so simple that it is unlikely to contain bugs, and is pre-configured to respond with a hard-coded response, presumably, the correct response <code>DatabaseStorage</code> is expected
        to return for the given test input.</p>
      <p>Here is how you can use the stub to write a unit test. This test is not affected by any bugs in the <code>DatabaseStorage</code> class and hence is a pure unit test.</p>
      <pre><code class="hljs java"><span class="hljs-meta">@Test</span>
<span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">void</span> <span class="hljs-title">getName</span><span class="hljs-params">()</span> </span>{

    <p><strong>Integration testing is not simply a repetition of the unit test cases but run using the actual dependencies</strong> (instead of the stubs used in unit testing). Instead, integration tests are additional test cases that focus on the interactions
      between the parts.</p>
    <tip-box>
      <p>📦 Suppose a class <code>Car</code> uses classes <code>Engine</code> and <code>Wheel</code>. Here is how you would go about doing pure integration tests:</p>
      <p>a) First, unit test <code>Engine</code> and <code>Wheel</code>.<br> b) Next, unit test <code>Car</code> in isolation of <code>Engine</code> and <code>Wheel</code>, <mark>using stubs for <code>Engine</code> and <code>Wheel</code></mark>.<br> c) After
        that, do an integration test for <code>Car</code> using it together with the <code>Engine</code> and <code>Wheel</code> classes to ensure the <code>Car</code> integrates properly with the <code>Engine</code> and the <code>Wheel</code>.</p>
    </tip-box>
    <p><strong>In practice, developers often use a hybrid of unit+integration tests to minimize the need for stubs.</strong></p>
    <tip-box>
      <p>📦 Here's how a hybrid unit+integration approach could be applied to the same example used above:</p>
      <p>(a) First, unit test <code>Engine</code> and <code>Wheel</code>.<br>
        <s>(b) Next, unit test <code>Car</code> in isolation of <code>Engine</code> and <code>Wheel</code>, using stubs for <code>Engine</code> and <code>Wheel</code>.</s><br> (c) After that, do an integration test for <code>Car</code> using it together
        with the <code>Engine</code> and <code>Wheel</code> classes to ensure the <code>Car</code> integrates properly with the <code>Engine</code> and the <code>Wheel</code>. <mark>This step should include test cases that are meant to test the unit <code>Car</code></mark>        (i.e. test cases used in the step (b) of the example above) as well as test cases that are meant to test the integration of <code>Car</code> with <code>Wheel</code> and <code>Engine</code> (i.e. pure integration test cases used of the step (c)
        in the example above).</p>
      <p>💡 Note that you no longer need stubs for <code>Engine</code> and <code>Wheel</code>. The downside is that <code>Car</code> is never tested in isolation of its dependencies. Given that its dependencies are already unit tested, the risk of bugs in
        <code>Engine</code> and <code>Wheel</code> affecting the testing of <code>Car</code> can be considered minimal.</p>

    <p><strong>System test cases are based on the specified external behavior of the system.</strong> Sometimes, system tests go beyond the bounds defined in the specification. This is useful when testing that the system fails 'gracefully' having pushed
      beyond its limits.</p>
    <tip-box>
      <p>📦 Suppose the SUT is a browser supposedly capable of handling web pages containing up to 5000 characters. Given below is a test case to test if the SUT fails gracefully if pushed beyond its limits.</p>

* Input: load a web page containing more than 5000 characters. 
* Expected behavior: abort the loading of the page and show a meaningful error message.

      <li><strong>Fixing a bug found during such testing could result in major rework</strong>, especially if the bug originated during the design or during requirements specification <span class="dimmed">i.e. a faulty design or faulty requirements</span>.</li>
      <li><strong>One bug might 'hide' other bugs</strong>, which could emerge only after the first bug is fixed.</li>
      <li><strong>The delivery may have to be delayed</strong> if too many bugs were found during testing.</li>

    <p><strong>Therefore, it is better to do early testing</strong>, as hinted by the popular rule of thumb given below, also illustrated by the graph below it.</p>

    <p><strong>Here are two alternative approaches to testing a software: <em>Scripted</em> testing and <em>Exploratory</em> testing</strong></p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Scripted testing:</strong> First write a set of test cases based on the expected behavior of the SUT, and then perform testing based on that set of test cases.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Exploratory testing:</strong> Devise test cases on-the-fly, creating new test cases based on the results of the past test cases.</p>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>Exploratory testing is ‘the simultaneous learning, test design, and test execution’
      <trigger trigger="click" for="modal:exploratoryWhat-bach-et-explained">[source: bach-et-explained]</trigger> whereby the nature of the follow-up test case is decided based on the behavior of the previous test cases. In other words, running the system and trying out various operations. It is called <em>exploratory testing</em>      because testing is driven by observations during testing. Exploratory testing usually starts with areas identified as error-prone, based on the tester’s past experience with similar systems. One tends to conduct more tests for those operations where
      more faults are found.</p>
    <tip-box>
      <p>📦 Here is an example thought process behind a segment of an exploratory testing session:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>“Hmm... looks like feature x is broken. This usually means feature n and k could be broken too; we need to look at them soon. But before that, let us give a good test run to feature y because users can still use the product if feature y works,
          even if x doesn’t work. Now, if feature y doesn’t work 100%, we have a major problem and this has to be made known to the development team sooner rather than later...”</p>
      </blockquote>
    </tip-box>
    <tip-box>
      <p>💡 <strong>Exploratory testing is also known as <em>reactive testing, error guessing technique, attack-based testing,</em> and <em>bug hunting</em>.</strong></p>

  <div>
    <p>Which approach is better – <strong>scripted or exploratory? A mix is better.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>The success of exploratory testing depends on the tester’s prior experience and intuition.</strong> Exploratory testing should be done by experienced testers, using a clear strategy/plan/framework. Ad-hoc exploratory testing by unskilled or
      inexperienced testers without a clear strategy is not recommended for real-world non-trivial systems. While <strong>exploratory testing may allow us to detect some problems in a relatively short time, it is not prudent to use exploratory testing as the sole means of testing a critical system</strong>.</p>
    <p><strong>Scripted testing is more systematic, and hence, likely to discover more bugs given sufficient time</strong>, while exploratory testing would aid in quick error discovery, especially if the tester has a lot of experience in testing similar
      systems.</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>In some contexts, you will achieve your testing mission better through a more scripted approach; in other contexts, your mission will benefit more from the ability to create and improve tests as you execute them. I find that most situations benefit
        from a mix of scripted and exploratory approaches. --

      <p><strong>Requirement Specification vs System Specification</strong></p>
      <p>The requirement specification need not be the same as the system specification. Some example differences:</p>

          <tr>

            <td style="text-align:left">can also include details on how it will fail gracefully when pushed beyond limits, how to recover, etc. specification</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>

      <p>However, <strong>in many cases one document serves as both a requirement specification and a system specification.</strong></p>

  </h4>
  <div>
    <p><strong>A simple way to semi-automate testing of a CLI(Command Line Interface) app is by using input/output re-direction.</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>First, we feed the app with a sequence of test inputs that is stored in a file while redirecting the output to another file.</li>
      <li>Next, we compare the actual output file with another file containing the expected output.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Let us assume we are testing a CLI app called <code>AddressBook</code>. Here are the detailed steps:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>Store the test input in the text file <code>input.txt</code>.</p>
        <panel header="%%:package: Example `input.txt`%%" type="seamless">
          <pre class="hljs"><code>add Valid Name p/12345 valid@email.butNoPrefix
add Valid Name 12345 e/valid@email.butPhonePrefixMissing
</code></pre>
        </panel>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Store the output we expect from the SUT in another text file <code>expected.txt</code>.</p>
        <panel header="%%:package: Example `expected.txt`%%" type="seamless">
          <pre class="hljs"><code>Command: || [add Valid Name p/12345 valid@email.butNoPrefix]
Invalid command format: add 

Command: || [add Valid Name 12345 e/valid@email.butPhonePrefixMissing]
Invalid command format: add 
</code></pre>
        </panel>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Run the program as given below, which will redirect the text in <code>input.txt</code> as the input to <code>AddressBook</code> and similarly, will redirect the output of AddressBook to a text file <code>output.txt</code>. <span class="dimmed">Note that this does not require any code changes to <code>AddressBook</code>.</span></p>
        <pre><code class="hljs sh">java AddressBook &lt; input.txt &gt; output.txt
</code></pre>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>💡 The way to run a CLI program differs based on the language.<br> e.g., In Python, assuming the code is in <code>AddressBook.py</code> file, use the command<br>
              <code>python AddressBook.py &lt; input.txt &gt; output.txt</code></p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>💡 If you are using Windows, use a normal command window to run the app, not a Power Shell window.</p>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <panel header="%%More on the `>` operator and the `<` operator. :zero:%%" alt="I/O redirection info" type="seamless">
          <p>A CLI program takes input from the keyboard and outputs to the console. That is because those two are default input and output streams, respectively. But you can change that behavior using <code>&lt;</code> and <code>&gt;</code> operators. For
            example, if you run <code>AddressBook</code> in a command window, the output will be shown in the console, but if you run it like this,</p>
          <pre><code class="hljs sh">java AddressBook &gt; output.txt 
</code></pre>
          <p>the Operating System then creates a file <code>output.txt</code> and stores the output in that file instead of displaying it in the console. No file I/O coding is required. Similarly, adding <code>&lt; input.txt</code> (or any other filename)
            makes the OS redirect the contents of the file as input to the program, as if the user typed the content of the file one line at a time.</p>

        <p></p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Next, we compare <code>output.txt</code> with the <code>expected.txt</code>. This can be done using a utility such as Windows <code>FC</code> (i.e. File Compare) command, Unix <code>diff</code> command, or a GUI tool such as <em>WinMerge</em>.</p>
        <pre class="hljs"><code>FC output.txt expected.txt
</code></pre>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>Note that the above technique is only suitable when testing CLI apps, and only if the exact output can be predetermined. <span class="dimmed">If the output varies from one run to the other (e.g. it contains a time stamp), this technique will not work.

    <p>If a software product has a GUI component, all product-level testing (i.e. the types of testing mentioned above) need to be done using the GUI. However, <strong>testing the GUI is much harder than testing the CLI (command line interface) or API</strong>,
      for the following reasons:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Most GUIs can support a large number of different operations, many of which can be performed in any arbitrary order.</li>
      <li>GUI operations are more difficult to automate than API testing. Reliably automating GUI operations and automatically verifying whether the GUI behaves as expected is harder than calling an operation and comparing its return value with an expected
        value. Therefore, automated regression testing of GUIs is rather difficult.</li>
      <li>The appearance of a GUI (and sometimes even behavior) can be different across platforms and even environments. For example, a GUI can behave differently based on whether it is minimized or maximized, in focus or out of focus, and in a high resolution
        display or a low resolution display.</li>
    </ul>
    <img src="/book/testing/testAutomation/testingGuis/images/diagram.png" height="120">
    <p></p>
    <p><strong>One approach to overcome the challenges of testing GUIs is to minimize logic aspects in the GUI.</strong> Then, bypass the GUI to test the rest of the system using automated API testing. While this still requires the GUI to be tested manually,
      the number of such manual test cases can be reduced as most of the system has been tested using automated API testing.</p>

    <p>Here are some examples of different coverage criteria:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Function/method coverage</strong> : based on functions executed <span class="dimmed"> e.g., testing executed 90 out of 100 functions</span>.</li>
      <li><strong>Statement coverage</strong> : based on the number of line of code executed <span class="dimmed"> e.g., testing executed 23k out of 25k LOC</span>.</li>
      <li><strong>Decision/branch coverage</strong> : based on the decision points exercised <span class="dimmed"> e.g., an <code>if</code> statement evaluated to both <code>true</code> and <code>false</code> with separate test cases during testing is considered 'covered'</span>.</li>
      <li><strong>Condition coverage</strong> : based on the boolean sub-expressions, each evaluated to both true and false with different test cases. Condition coverage is not the same as the decision coverage.</li>
    </ul>
    <tip-box>
      <p>📦 <code>if(x &gt; 2 &amp;&amp; x &lt; 44)</code> is considered one decision point but two conditions.</p>
      <p>For 100% branch or decision coverage, two test cases are required:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><code>(x &gt; 2 &amp;&amp; x &lt; 44) == true</code> : [e.g. <code>x == 4</code>]</li>
        <li><code>(x &gt; 2 &amp;&amp; x &lt; 44) == false</code> : [e.g. <code>x == 100</code>]</li>
      </ul>
      <p>For 100% condition coverage, three test cases are required</p>
      <ul>
        <li><code>(x &gt; 2) == true</code> , <code>(x &lt; 44) == true</code> : [e.g. <code>x == 4</code>]</li>
        <li><code>(x &lt; 44) == false</code> : [e.g. <code>x == 100</code>]</li>
        <li><code>(x &gt; 2) == false</code> : [e.g. <code>x == 0</code>]</li>
      </ul>
    </tip-box>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Path coverage</strong> measures coverage in terms of possible paths through a given part of the code executed. 100% path coverage means all possible paths have been executed. A commonly used notation for path analysis is called the <em>Control Flow Graph (CFG)</em>.</li>
      <li><strong>Entry/exit coverage</strong> measures coverage in terms of possible <em>calls to</em> and <em>exits</em> from the operations in the SUT.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <h4 id="how-star-15">How <small><small>⭐️</small></small>
  </h4>
  <div>
    <p><strong>Measuring coverage is often done using <em>coverage analysis tools</em>.</strong> Most IDEs have inbuilt support for measuring test coverage, or at least have plugins that can measure test coverage.</p>
    <p><strong>Coverage analysis can be useful in improving the quality of testing</strong> <span class="dimmed"> e.g., if a set of test cases does not achieve 100% branch coverage, more test cases can be added to cover missed branches</span>.</p>

    <tip-box>
      <div id="isValidMonth">
        <p><code>isValidMonth(m)</code> : returns <code>true</code> if <code>m</code> (and <code>int</code>) is in the range [1..12]</p>
      </div>
    </tip-box>
    <p>It is inefficient and impractical to test this method for all integer values <code>[-MIN_INT to MAX_INT]</code>. Fortunately, there is no need to test all possible input values. For example, if the input value <code>233</code> failed to produce the
      correct result, the input <code>234</code> is likely to fail too; there is no need to test both.</p>
    <p>In general, <strong>most SUTs do not treat each input in a unique way. Instead, they process all possible inputs in a small number of distinct ways.</strong> That means a range of inputs is treated the same way inside the SUT.
      <strong><em>Equivalence partitioning (EP)</em> is a test case design technique that uses the above observation to improve the E&amp;E of testing.</strong></p>
    <tip-box type="definition">

    <p>When the SUT has multiple inputs, you should identify EPs for each input.</p>
    <tip-box>
      <p>📦 Consider the method <code>duplicate(String s, int n): String</code> which returns a <code>String</code> that contains <code>s</code> repeated <code>n</code> times.</p>
      <p>Example EPs for <code>s</code>:</p>

        <li>zero-length strings</li>
        <li>string containing whitespaces</li>
        <li>...</li>

        <li><code>0</code></li>
        <li>negative values</li>
        <li>...</li>
      </ul>
    </tip-box>
    <p>An EP may not have adjacent values.</p>
    <tip-box>
      <p>📦 Consider the method <code>isPrime(int i): boolean</code> that returns true if <code>i</code> is a prime number.</p>
      <p>EPs for <code>i</code>:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>prime numbers</li>
        <li>non-prime numbers</li>
      </ul>
    </tip-box>
    <p>Some inputs have only a small number of possible values and a potentially unique behavior for each value. In those cases we have to consider each value as a partition by itself.</p>
    <tip-box>
      <p>📦 Consider the method <code>showStatusMessage(GameStatus s): String</code> that returns a unique <code>String</code> for each of the possible value of s (<code>GameStatus</code> is an <code>enum</code>). In this case, each possible value for <code>s</code>        will have to be considered as a partition.</p>
    </tip-box>
    <p>Note that the EP technique is merely a heuristic and not an exact science, especially when applied manually (as opposed to using an automated program analysis tool to derive EPs). The partitions derived depend on how one ‘speculates’ the SUT to behave
      internally. Applying EP under a glass-box or gray-box approach can yield more precise partitions.</p>
    <tip-box>
      <p>📦 Consider the method EPs given above for the <code>isValidMonth</code>. A different tester might use these EPs instead:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>[1 … 12] : the range that produces <code>true</code></li>
        <li>[all other integers] : the range that produces <code>false</code></li>

      <p>📦 Consider a simple Minesweeper app. What are the EPs for the <code>newGame()</code> method of the <code>Logic</code> component?</p>
      <p>As <code>newGame()</code> does not have any parameters, the only obvious participant is the <code>Logic</code> object itself.</p>
      <p>Note that if the glass-box or the grey-box approach is used, other associated objects that are involved in the method might also be included as participants. For example, <code>Minefield</code> object can be considered as another participant of
        the <code>newGame()</code> method. Here, the black-box approach is assumed.</p>
      <p>Next, let us identify equivalence partitions for each participant. Will the <code>newGame()</code> method behave differently for different <code>Logic</code> objects? If yes, how will it differ? In this case, yes, it might behave differently based
        on the game state. Therefore, the equivalence partitions are:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><code>PRE_GAME</code> : before the game starts, minefield does not exist yet</li>
        <li><code>READY</code> : a new minefield has been created and waiting for player’s first move</li>
        <li><code>IN_PLAY</code> : the current minefield is already in use</li>
        <li><code>WON</code>, <code>LOST</code> : let us assume the <code>newGame</code> behaves the same way for these two values</li>
      </ul>

      <p>📦 Consider the <code>Logic</code> component of the Minesweeper application. What are the EPs for the <code>markCellAt(int x, int y)</code> method?. The partitions in <strong>bold</strong> represent valid inputs.</p>

  <h4 id="what-star-68">What <small><small>⭐️</small></small>
  </h4>
  <div>
    <p><strong><em>Boundary Value Analysis (BVA)</em> is test case design heuristic that is based on the observation that bugs often result from incorrect handling of boundaries of equivalence partitions.</strong> This is not surprising, as the end points
      of the boundary are often used in branching instructions etc. where the programmer can make mistakes.</p>
    <tip-box>
      <p>📦 <code>markCellAt(int x, int y)</code> operation could contain code such as if <code>(x &gt; 0 &amp;&amp; x &lt;= (W-1))</code> which involves boundaries of x’s equivalence partitions.</p>
    </tip-box>
    <p><strong>BVA suggests that when picking test inputs from an equivalence partition, values near boundaries (i.e. boundary values) are more likely to find bugs.</strong></p>
    <p>Boundary values are sometimes called <em>corner cases</em>.</p>
  </div>
  <h4 id="how-star-18">How <small><small>⭐️</small></small>
  </h4>
  <div>
    <p><strong>Typically, we choose three values around the boundary to test: one value from the boundary, one value just below the boundary, and one value just above the boundary.</strong> The number of values to pick depends on other factors, such as the
      cost of each test case.</p>

    <p>It looks like the test cases were created using the ‘at least once’ strategy. After running these tests can we confirm that square-format label printing is done correctly? Answer: No. Reason: <code>Cherry</code> -- the only input that can produce
      a square-format label -- is in a negative test case which produces an error message instead of a label. If there is a bug in the code that prints labels in square-format, these tests cases will not trigger that bug.</p>
    <p>In this case a useful heuristic to apply is <strong>each valid input must appear at least once in a positive test case</strong>. <code>Cherry</code> is a valid test input and we must ensure that it appears at least once in a positive test case. Here
      are the updated test cases after applying that heuristic.</p>

    <p>After running these test cases can you be sure that the error message “invalid price” is shown for negative prices? Answer: No. Reason: <code>-1</code> -- the only input that is a negative price – is in a test case that produces the error message
      “invalid fruit”.</p>
    <p>In this case a useful heuristic to apply is <strong>no more than one invalid input in a test case</strong>. After applying that, we get the following test cases.</p>

    <p>Next, let us assume that there is a dependency between the inputs <code>examScore</code> and <code>isAbsent</code> such that an absent student can only have <code>examScore=0</code>. To cater for the hidden invalid case arising from this, we can add
      a new test case where <code>isAbsent=true</code> and <code>examScore!=0</code>. In addition, test cases 3-6.2 should have <code>isAbsent=false</code> so that the input remains valid.</p>

    <p><strong>Use cases can be used for system testing and acceptance testing</strong>. For example, the main success scenario can be one test case while each variation (due to extensions) can form another test case. However, note that use cases do not
      specify the exact data entered into the system. Instead, it might say something like <code>user enters his personal data into the system</code>. Therefore, the tester has to choose data by considering equivalence partitions and boundary values.
      The combinations of these could result in one use case producing many test cases.</p>
    <p>To increase
      <trigger trigger="click" for="modal:usebaseBased-EandE">E&amp;E of testing</trigger>, high-priority use cases are given more attention. For example, a
      <trigger trigger="click" for="modal:usecaseBased-scripted">scripted approach</trigger> can be used to test high priority test cases, while an exploratory approach is used to test other areas of concern that could emerge during testing.</p>

        <p><strong>Every test case adds to the cost of testing.</strong> In some systems, a single test case can cost thousands of dollars <span class="dimmed"> e.g. on-field testing of flight-control software</span>. Therefore, <strong>test cases need to be designed to make the best use of testing resources.</strong>          In particular:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p><strong>Testing should be <em>effective</em></strong> i.e., it finds a high percentage of existing bugs <span class="dimmed">e.g., a set of test cases that finds 60 defects is more effective than a set that finds only 30 defects in the same system</span>.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p><strong>Testing should be <em>efficient</em></strong> i.e., it has a high rate of success (bugs found/test cases) <span class="dimmed">a set of 20 test cases that finds 8 defects is more efficient than another set of 40 test cases that finds the same 8 defects</span>.</p>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>For testing to be <tooltip content="Efficient and Effective">E&amp;E</tooltip>, each new test we add should be targeting a potential fault that is not already targeted by existing test cases.</strong> There are test case design techniques

              <p><strong>Here are two alternative approaches to testing a software: <em>Scripted</em> testing and <em>Exploratory</em> testing</strong></p>
              <ol>
                <li>
                  <p><strong>Scripted testing:</strong> First write a set of test cases based on the expected behavior of the SUT, and then perform testing based on that set of test cases.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p><strong>Exploratory testing:</strong> Devise test cases on-the-fly, creating new test cases based on the results of the past test cases.</p>
                </li>
              </ol>
              <p>Exploratory testing is ‘the simultaneous learning, test design, and test execution’
                <trigger trigger="click" for="modal:exploratoryWhat-bach-et-explained">[source: bach-et-explained]</trigger> whereby the nature of the follow-up test case is decided based on the behavior of the previous test cases. In other words, running the system and trying out various operations. It is called <em>exploratory testing</em>                because testing is driven by observations during testing. Exploratory testing usually starts with areas identified as error-prone, based on the tester’s past experience with similar systems. One tends to conduct more tests for those operations
                where more faults are found.</p>
              <tip-box>
                <p>📦 Here is an example thought process behind a segment of an exploratory testing session:</p>
                <blockquote>
                  <p>“Hmm... looks like feature x is broken. This usually means feature n and k could be broken too; we need to look at them soon. But before that, let us give a good test run to feature y because users can still use the product if feature
                    y works, even if x doesn’t work. Now, if feature y doesn’t work 100%, we have a major problem and this has to be made known to the development team sooner rather than later...”</p>

                      <li>The ‘to same woman’ partition has a risk of misunderstanding between developer and user. For example, the developer might think it is OK to ignore the request while the users might expect to see an error message.</li>

                    <p>Explanation: Since it is an executable only, you are unlikely to have a knowledge of its internal workings. Therefore, your testing is most likely to be black-box testing. A ‘test drive’ sounds like exploratory testing rather than
                      scripted testing.</p>

                    <p>Explanation: In fact, when we know about how the SUT is implemented, we can make more informed decisions about partitioning test input into equivalence partitions. White-box equivalence partitioning is less speculative than black-box
                      equivalence partitioning.</p>
