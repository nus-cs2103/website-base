Good to see most of you found the course briefing videos useful. Previously, course admin info used to be
covered during weekly briefings, but since a year ago we started extracting them out as a separate
category of videos called 'course briefing' videos.

Glad to see most found weekly briefings to be useful.

A general note: Unlike most courses where lectures are the main channel for delivering content,
 our weekly briefings are a complementary “top up”. They cover extra examples, motivations behind topics,
 commentary on shaping your attitudes towards the subject, anecdotes, and more.
 If you’re short on time or find them unhelpful, you may skip the briefings or simply speed-watch the recordings later.
 Even the quiz questions in briefings are effectively optional, as they are unlikely
  to affect your final participation marks.<br>
 **:fas-exclamation: Caveat: Totally ignoring weekly briefings will disqualify you from future CS2103/T 
 tutor positions**
 though, as we do not want to employ as a tutor someone who hasn't received the _full view_ of the course.

The feedback for the course website is quite positive but there are still _some_ areas to improve further.
  Thanks for your feedback on those. We will continue to try and improve the website whenever we can.<br>
  In the meantime, we thank you for your patience with the website -- it's not easy to disseminate that much
  of information in a way that fits everyone's expectations %%(e.g., some prefer content to be more 'visual'
  while others prefer minimalistic presentation)%%,
  and we realize that ==it is not easy for you to consume that much of information== either.

**Common complaint: too much to read!** It is true that our course website has a LOT more text content
 than one would expect. Some of it was added because at some point a student needed that (e.g., a student
 asks for some information that we realize is not present in the website -- so we add it).
 We do try to arrange the content in a way that is easier to navigate/consume, but it is hard, and I'm
 sure the current format and the level of details do not fit some of you.
 
 **We also realize some are less inclined to absorb information via the text medium** (preferring other mediums
 such as demos, videos). We try to provide alternative formats as well -- we'll try to do more. 
 Note that the text format also has the advantage that it is the format you'll be referring to
 during the exam.
 
 **Common complaint: website is not intuitive to navigate:** 
I totally get why a “flatter” website with less nesting might seem easier to use—many great sites are designed that way.
The tricky part is that our site has a huge amount of content with lots of cross-links, since the same material becomes
relevant at different points in the semester. Because of the iterative way we cover both the project and the topics, the
site ends up being more like a Java codebase than a regular website—imagine trying to read a codebase straight through
without jumping around!

We actually tested this a while back by running an 
[A/B test](https://hbr.org/2017/06/a-refresher-on-ab-testing#:~:text=What%20Is%20A,100%20years%20old.): 
we created a flatter version and a nester (similar to the current) version and let students used whichever version
 they prefer. At the start of the semester, usage was split fairly evenly, but by the end, over 95% of students
had switched to the nested version. After trying this for two semesters, we retired the flat version, since keeping both
going was too much work.

That said, a small number of students did prefer the flatter version, which shows there’s no one-size-fits-all solution.
So apologies if you find the structure confusing—we’ll keep working on ways to make it better.

**:fas-comment: My comments:**


Admittedly, if you are someone who normally prepare well for the tutorials and actively take part
 in tutorial discussions, our tutorials can feel slow, less efficient, or less active. 
 We hope you still bear with us because ==the tutorial structure 
  (like many other things in this course)
  aims to _raise the lower bar of the whole class_, which is important when there is a major team project
  (to reduce the skill gap between team members)==.
  * **We had to move to F2F mode**, to comply with NUS
    policy. Although online tutorials seem like a more 'efficient' mode (e.g., no need for travel), we expect physically
    meeting with team members often will have some intangible benefits for you in the long run.<br>
    We still use Zoom out of necessity (e.g., to share slides, to collect answers), and to get the best of
    both modes (e.g., to have a recording of the tutorial).<br>
  * **Having two tutorials in the same venue is not ideal**, but we have no choice due to lack of enough
    small venues. So, it is a compromise we've made to keep tutor-to-student ratio low while making do with the
    current venues we have. 
  * **We start with a 10-minute warm up** to give everyone at least a chance to familiarize with the tutorial tasks
    even if they haven't had time to look at them earlier (we don't want them to be left out entirely).
  * **By requiring _everyone_ to respond via private messages**, we aim to get everyone to _think_ about the topic
    at hand and attempt to answer without being biased by others’ answers.
    Pedagogy research has shown that this act of thinking/attempting
    before receiving the correct answer increases the effectiveness of learning,
    even if you get the answer wrong at first.<br>
    That said, we do want to have some verbal discussions to happen too. That's why we ask you to do the follow up
    discussions verbally.
  * **We monitor tutorial participation** because tutorials are used for ensuring that you all have achieved the desired
    learning targets for the week. If not, slower students tend to neglect the theory part 
    (in a misguided attempt to save time) and try to brute-force the project work, which wastes even more time,
    and also exacerbates the skill-gap problems in their teams.
  * **Less is more, hopefully**: So, while our tutorials only discuss a small number of relatively simpler questions,
    _getting everyone to answer almost every question on the spot_ 
    has ==a higher total learning gain for the entire class,
    although the learning gain for stronger students may be less than usual==.<br>
    So, if you are one of the
    stronger students getting less out of our tutorials than you are used to get from other courses, we hope
    you'll be generous and take a 'hit' here to allow your classmates to level up. You might even benefit yourself
    from their levelled-up contributions when you work with them in the team project.

**:fas-comment: My comments:**


The pace seems to be an issue for some of you, although it seems to be manageable for most.<br>
**We need to go through topics faster than other courses** because you need to have some time left
 _after_ covering a topic to apply that knowledge into the project. 
 So, we need to finish covering topics about 2 weeks before the tP
 finishes, which means ==compressing 13-weeks worth of topics into about 10 weeks== 
 (having the lecture on Friday means we also lose most of the week 1 too). 
Don't worry if you feel like the course is moving too fast; thanks to the iterative approach we use for covering topics,
 you'll get multiple chances to solidify your familiarity of a topic/tool.

The most common concern about this course is the workload. As per the responses tally above, it seems
fewer students chose `*.5` options. So, given below is the view if we merge `n` and `n.5` bars.

Either way, it is interesting to see peaks around 4, 5, 6, and 8, showing a big variation of how students
perceive the workload of this course.

**Why some students feel the workload as MUCH higher compared to others?** 
Here's a recap of the possible reasons for this that I mentioned during the Week 2->3 briefing:

1. **%%Possible reason:%% You are doing more work than others.**<br>
   Response: If this is because you are doing the course more sincerely (e.g., not skipping even optional
   topics/tasks), it will pay off (i.e., you'll learn more) but you still might want to re-calibrate the time
   you spend on this course if you don't have enough time for other courses.<br>
   If this is because you are unaware of ways to reduce the workload (e.g., omitting optional topics),
   refer to the recommendations given further below.
1. **%%Possible reason:%% You need more time than others to complete course tasks**
   because you are an inexperienced coder.<br>
   Response: The good news is, you are getting more value from this course than others (your skills will
   improve a lot more from the course compared to others). But it is unavoidable that there is a price to pay
   (i.e., the extra time you spend on the course). If this is affecting your other courses, you might want to
   to cut down the work you do in the course, with the understanding that your skill improvement will be less too.
1. **%%Possible reason:%% You are taking short-cuts** (e.g., not doing weekly topics before you attempt weekly
   project tasks) to save time, but end up spending even more time as you lack the knowledge needed
   to do the task. For example, we noticed some who didn't do the JavaFX tutorial first ran into problems
   when doing iP Level-10, and wasted a lot of time troubleshooting them.<br>
   Response: This is concerning, and ill-advised (it results in a lose-lose outcome -- less learning, more time wasted).
   Instead, to reduce the time spent on this course without loosing too much value, follow our instructions/schedule
   closely, but omit optional topics/tasks and stop when you have reached the minimum requirement.


**We know the workload concern is real**, and we firmly believe that no course should take more than
    its fair share of students' time. This course aims to teach you SE skills that take a lot
    of practice, which makes the workload feel heavy, especially if you are a beginner coder.<br>
  On our side, ==we have lowered the bar for the tP implementation component by half==
  in recent semesters, and we have further cut down the tP documentation requirement recently. 
  Hopefully, it'll make the workload of the second half lighter than in previous rounds.

**Some recommendations for you:**
  * If you struggled with the iP workload, don’t be too ambitious with the tP.<br>
    Reminder: there are no marks allocated for marking the product interesting, unique, cool, etc.<br>
    Also, keep in mind that it is the quality that will count more than the quantity. 
    In most cases the quantity is graded on an S/U basis.
    Aim to do less but do it really well.<br>
    ==Plan to add/update tP features in small steps== (each step leading to a usable and slightly better version
    of the feature), so that you can stop any time the workload seems to be exceeding what you are prepared for.
  * If you don't have time to study all topics, use the 
    [topic levels system](https://nus-cs2103-ay2526s1.github.io/website/admin/courseExpectations.html#topic-levels:~:text=things%20to%20do.-,Topic%20Levels,-We%20use%20a)
    to figure out which topics are higher priority.

<markdown>I think there is definitely a lot of content because there about almost over 40-50 pages of topic notes to read every week and I really feel that while it is the standard practise in industry for SWE engineers to read documentations it is still very time consuming (I spend about 5 hours reading these documentations weekly). Also it means that about 50*7 = 350 pages of content are going to be tested for midterms which makes it a bit hard to grapple if one doesn't already have hands on some form of summary of the materials. I had tried to find videos with condensed information online but sadly these vidoes are either -- too short (only covers class diagram and no follow up on object diagram) or too long (2 hours of videos by CodeCamping and materials are quite different from that of 2103). I guess it is really tough to provide a comprehensive yet un-taxing SE education afterall. 

However, I like how the module is probably going to be one of the most useful for work though and I have definitely improved in OOP thinking and no longer so scared of SWE even though I didnt do well for 2030s. I am still really scared about midterms and finals though. Hopefully I'll be able to do decently for this module. </markdown>

<markdown>I like the tutorial approach to sit in a circle so everyone is facing each other.

I also like the zoom approach as I understand it is so everyone gets a chance to answer questions.

A small QoL I would suggest would be regarding the utilization of zoom, teams, course website, Google docs, Ide and more all within the span of 1hr is really messy and without prepping we can have to rush. Maybe having a list of sites to use before the tutorial will help overcome this.

Another small QoL is the utilization of all these software etc, drains the laptop battery really fast. Combined with sitting in a circle, in the middle of the class puts the charging ports out of reach. Can I suggest a V shape instead so the person at the edge can still access the ports. Another reason I suggest a V shape is that despite the original circular sitting letting everyone see each other, it serves little purpose since everyone is looking down on their zoom screen. 1 hr can be considered the bare minimum for a laptop to run without being plugged in, but that's if it is not under heavy utilization, in my opinion. Cable extensions work too :D

 </markdown>

<box type="info" icon=":fas-comment:" light><span class="text-info"><markdown>Glad you liked the tutorial approach. 



Good point about needing to access many sites for the tutorial. It is hard for us to provide this from our side, as some links vary by the student (e.g., tutorial zoom link). Perhaps you can create your own shortcuts using the bookmarks feature in your browser?



We tried provide extension codes in previous semesters but they are hard to secure and kept disappearing. But feel free to move near to a power outlet if you run out of battery. All tutorial locations have 1-2 power outlets nearby.</markdown>

<markdown>So far the weekly topics reading + IP workload is ridiculously high. There is also a lot of content covered that we have to learn. It feels like this mod could be split into 2 mods separately.

While the mod states that we can choose how much time we spend, most things like learning git and UML are very time consuming and if we skip those we suffer for the iP and tP which causes us to spend that time anyways so no matter what the time spent is still very high.</markdown>

<box type="info" icon=":fas-comment:" light><span class="text-info"><markdown>Yes, the workload does seem high to some students. As you correctly realised, the investment in learning some of these things will pay off in the iP and the tP.

<markdown>I do believe the workload is close to 12u actually. For the weekly work requirement and content to read and watch is far beyond a standard module's workload. Although I do agree that the website is very detailed, this is also a double edged sword. Just because content may be marked as optional doesn't mean that they shouldn't be read and in effect means we as students to ensure we don't miss content will still read everything. Additionally the website is very cluttered with content, content links and iframe content which can dampen the reader. This is similar to how we want to refrain from writing superfluous code, heavily optimized or indented code.</markdown>

<markdown>Feels like workload is a lot especially the first few weeks when there is a lot of material to cover (the git basics). I feel like the textbook should have videos for most of the sections, including the git tours since the huge wall of text can feel dry after trying to follow the notes.

Workload is high especially in weeks 2 and 3, there were many iP increments to complete and i was spending hours every day just to keep up. Honestly, feels way more workload than 8 units as i feel that i spent more time on CS2103 than the rest of my mods combined (for weeks 2 and 3 at least)</markdown>

The notes are also very substantial and sufficient for our learning. However, I think for links to external sites, which tend to be for the harder stuff to do such as JXML and niche/new stuff that we've not learnt before, I think it'll be nice to explain what we are doing instead of us just following the link/tutorial steps. I feel like explanations at the start are sufficient, but it kind of tapers down towards the end, so I got lost after the midpoint.</markdown>

<markdown>The grading scheme of the individual project is very unfair because:

* There is no clear definition of a "good-quality project" sample given, which makes it extremely difficult for the students to self-judge their own code quality relative to the cohort's overall level (we really do not have the time to go through the repos one by one)

* I appreciate the idea that individual project scores are not bell-curved. However, I believe it is much better to separate the score range into a handful of (say 5) tiers instead of the current "either 100% or 50%" policy. It is acceptable if a 99-mark project and an 80-mark project both receive 100%, but not so acceptable in my opinion if a 99-mark project and a 51-mark project both receive 100%. Such a grading scheme is just frustrating and makes me lose the motivation to polish my project

Additionally, some of the course's requirements are almost over-engineering. For example, the over-emphasis on UML even regarding the tiniest detail in notations, and the enforcement to write JavaDoc for every method/class even when their purpose is immediately clear from their name.</markdown>

<box type="info" icon=":fas-comment:" light><span class="text-info"><markdown>I'm glad you wish to pitch yourself against a more stringent grading scheme. The basis of the current iP grading scheme is that *everyone* must reach a certain level of competency. If you do more than that in the iP, you still benefit because you will learn more and also be able to score more (or with less effort) in the tP. Another issue with finer-grained scoring for the iP is the difficulty of uniformly grading 600+ projects against such a fine-grain rubric -- it will be near impossible to implement.



As per our coding standard, you don't need to write javadocs for private methods, overridden methods, getters/setters etc. You can also omit @params @returns etc if they don't add value.</markdown>

Given below are some general responses to points you guys (and past students) raised multiple times:

* **The course load is too high around week 3-4**: It is true that some increments in week 3 and 4 causes a peak
  of workload during that period. However, increments causing that (e.g., A-Gradle, Level-10) need to be done
  around that time because they are prerequisites for later increments. Also, any peak in workload is better to
  appear around that period i.e., not too early in the semester but not close to the final submission so that
  there is plenty of time for you to catch up should you fall behind during that period.
  Setting a slightly higher bar around that period can cause some students to fall behind a bit,
  which hopefully pushes them to work harder to catch up while there is still enough time to catch up
  i.e., it is better to fall behind early rather than later.<br>
  Finally, unexpected spikes in workload is not uncommon in SE projects. It is good to practice how to 
  deal with them.
* **Give more videos**: Indeed, we intend to add more videos, especially for the Git topics -- creating videos take
  time but we will be adding more over time.
* **Audio too soft in pre-recorded videos**: Those videos were recorded in PowerPoint first and then converted to
  videos. It turns out that when converting slides to videos,
  PowerPoint fades out the audio during slide transitions, which is why the audio is
  sometimes too soft. Unfortunately, we noticed this too late. The remedy is to re-record the affected videos,
  which is going to require a substantial effort. We are hoping to do that in a future semester.
