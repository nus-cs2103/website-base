### TIC2002 Website

[Live Website (redirected)](http://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~tic2002)

## Setting up

1. Clone this repo.
1. Run `git submodule update --init --recursive` to pull the content of the submodule.
1. [Install MarkBind](https://github.com/MarkBind/markbind-cli/wiki/User-Quick-Start#installation)

## Updating content

1. Checkout the branch of the course e.g., `cs2103`
1. Update content using MarkBind syntax ([How to use MarkBind](https://github.com/MarkBind/markbind-cli/wiki))
1. `markbind serve` to start the local server (to preview changes). This command also initiates the live-preview ability i.e. when any changes to the MarkBind code is saved, the site is auto-generated and the Web page (that was opened by the `serve` command) auto-refreshes to show the new content. This works well for small websites but not so well for this website. Recommended to shutdown the server (`Ctrl+C`) before doing further edits.
1. When you are happy with the edits, use the `markbind deploy` to deploy to the GitHub website at the `origin` repo.
   1. If the deployment failed due to a 'caching' issue, try deleting the the cache generated by the previous deploy command (on Windows, the cache can be found in `/c/Users/{user-name}/AppData/Roaming/npm/node_modules/markbind-cli/node_modules/gh-pages/.cache`)
1. If you need to update contents inside the `book` folder,
   1. Post an issue in the [se-edu/se-book issue tracker](https://github.com/se-edu/se-book/issues) to request for the change
   1. After the change has been done, pull the sub-module, and commit the changes to sub-module reference (when you pull a sub-module, Git automatically updates the submodule reference which is seen as a change in the enclosing repo).
      ```
      $ cd book
      $ git pull origin master
      $ cd ..
      $ git commit -am "sync with book"
      ```
   1. Deploy the website to make the updated book content visible to students
