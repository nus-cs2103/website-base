## Appendix A: Installing 3rd-Party Modules

In addition to built-in modules you get with Python by default, there are many modules written by others that you can make use of. **You can install third-party modules using Python’s `pip` tool**. This tool downloads and installs Python modules onto your computer from https://pypi.python.org/ (aka _PyPi_ or _Python Package Index_).

First, ensure that you have `pip` installed by running this command in a command shell (not Python interpreter shell), which should print out the version of the pip tool you have.

```
pip --version
```

After that, to install a third-party module (or _packages_ as they are sometimes called), you can run the `pip install {packagename}` command.

{{ icon_example }} The example below shows how to install the `colorama` module that allows you to colorize text printed out to the console.

```bash
pip install colorama
```
{{ icon_output }}
```
Collecting colorama
  Downloading colorama-0.3.9-py2.py3-none-any.whl
Installing collected packages: colorama
Successfully installed colorama-0.3.9
```
After installing colorama, you can import it into your code and use its features to print colorized text.
```python
import colorama

colorama.init()  # one-time initialization

print(colorama.Fore.YELLOW + ' Some yellow text')
print(colorama.Fore.BLUE + colorama.Back.WHITE + ' Some blue text in a white background')
print(colorama.Style.RESET_ALL + ' Back to normal now')
```
