    <div>
      <p><strong>Where is everything?</strong> CS2103/T-related information are mainly in one of these two places:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The <strong><a href="../schedule/index.html">Schedule page</a></strong> (organized chronologically): That is the one page you need to refer weekly.</li>
        <li><strong>Module handbook</strong> (i.e. this page. organized by topic) This is a reference document supplementary to the schedule page. This page contains a lot of text, probably too much to read in one sitting. Instead, <mark>skim through it quickly to learn what it contains.</mark>          You can come back to read details as-and-when the need arises. The schedule page lists relevant sections of the Handbook you should read at various points.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>CS2103 Vs CS2103T</strong>: Same lectures, same exam. Separate tutorials, separate project grading. Unless specified otherwise, whatever is stated for one module applies to the other.</p>

  <h1 id="learning-outcomes">Learning Outcomes</h1>
  <div id="handbook-learning-outcomes">
    <div>
      <p>This module is organized primarily around a list of Learning Outcomes.</p>
      <p>Each week has a suggested list of LOs. They are categorized using using the following star-rating system:</p>

  <h1 id="lectures">Lectures</h1>
  <div id="handbook-lectures">
    <div><img src="/cs2103-website/handbook/images/Lecture photo.png" style="width: 713px;">
      <p><strong>Timing/venue</strong>: Fri 1400-1600 ICube Auditorium. Lectures start at 1400 sharp and end around 1545 (15 minutes to travel to next lecture).</p>
      <p>Each lecture consists of two sections:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>First half: <em>Flipped classroom</em> format. Discusses the learning outcomes of the current week.</li>
        <li>Second half: A preview of the learning outcomes for the following week.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Attendance</strong>: Attendance for the <mark>first lecture is compulsory</mark>.</p>
      <p><strong>Webcast</strong>: All lectures will be webcast. However, some things are not captured well in the webcast recording. You are advised to treat the webcast as a 'backup' for you to catch up anything missed during the lecture.</p>
      <p><strong>Handouts</strong>: All learning materials are organized around learning outcomes (not lectures or topics), are given in Web format, and can be found in the <a href="../book/index.html">Textbook</a> section and are also hyperlinked from the
        <a href="../schedule/index.html">Schedule Page</a>.</p>
      <p><strong>Slides</strong>: Our lecture slides are not suited for printing or using as a reference during the lecture/exams. Tey are only an aid for lecture delivery. Slides will be uploaded <em>after</em> the lecture.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <h1 id="tutorials">Tutorials</h1>
  <div id="handbook-tutorials">
    <div>
      <p><mark>IMPORTANT: Our tutorials start on week 2 (even before CORS tutorial bidding is over), not in week 3 as other modules do. CS2103 (not CS2103T) students need to choose a temporary tutorial slot for week 2 tutorial. We'll inform you the procedure to do so in due course.</mark></p>
      <p><strong>What happens during the tutorial</strong>:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>A tutorial has two tutors. Each tutor will work with two teams.</li>
        <li>The tutor will direct students to share/discuss evidence of achieving the learning outcomes (LO) allocated to the week.</li>
        <li>If some students have met with difficulties while achieving an LO, the tutor can direct those students to get help from those who have achieved the LO. <mark>The number of LOs that can be covered in the tutorial session depends on how well-prepared you are.</mark></li>
        <li>The tutor will observe, and give feedback on, how well you are achieving required LOs.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>The role of our tutors</strong> is different from tutors in other modules.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>No direct tech help</strong>: Tutors are prohibited from giving technical help, because we want you to learn the vital survival skill of troubleshooting technical problems.<br><span class="dimmed">[cf Appendix D: How to get tech help]</span></li>
        <li><strong>No ‘teaching’</strong>: Tutors are prohibited from “teaching” concepts that are covered in lectures or handouts. Self-learning is a vital part of the module. But tutors may help you clarify doubts. For example consider these two questions
          you might want to ask a tutor:
          <ul>
            <li><em>This is how I understood/applied coupling. Is that correct?</em> - Such questions are welcome.<br><strong>Reason</strong>:This question shows you have put in some effort to learn the topic and seeking further clarification from the tutor.</li>
            <li><em>What is coupling?</em> - Such questions will not be entertained.<br><strong>Reason</strong>: This question implies you haven’t done what you could to learn the topic in concern.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>No leading from the front</strong>: Tutors are not expected to lead your project effort. They will not tell you how to do project tasks or when to do project tasks. You have to figure those out yourselves. But tutors will give you feedback
          on how you are doing (or have done) project tasks so that you can improve further.<br><span class="dimmed">[Cf external resource: <a href="">A practitioner article about receiving feedback</a>]</span></li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Timing/venue:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Please refer to the Schedule page for further details on each tutorial.</li>
        <li>You are expected to arrive on time.
          <ul>
            <li>If your tutorial is in <strong>COM1-B103</strong>: If you arrive early, you may enter the tutorial room by the door near the staircase and wait in the empty area of the room until the current class vacates the room.</li>
            <li>If your tutorial is in <strong>SR5</strong> or <strong>SR10</strong>: If you arrive early, please wait outside the room until you are asked to come in.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>You may leave the class 15 minutes before the hour if you have another class right after. There is no need to wait till the tutor dismisses you. However, inform the tutor (as a courtesy) before leaving if you leave before the class is dismissed.</li>
        <li>Please make sure you <mark>vacate the table 5 minutes before the hour</mark> so that the next group can start on time.</li>
        <li>In the past many students have suggested to increase the tutorial duration because 1 hour is barely enough to get through all the tutorial tasks. Increasing the tutorial time is not possible due to lack of venues and tutors. Instead, let's try
          to make the best of the one hour available by coming well prepared and starting on time.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Grading:</strong></p>
      <p>Tutorials are not graded. However, your conduct will be reviewed by team members and the tutor which will determine your participation marks.</p>
      <p><strong>Other expectations:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Please bring your laptop to tutorials.</strong> You often need it to show your learning activity results. At other times, we ask you to work on project related things with your team members, which too may require the laptop. <span class="dimmed">Cf FAQ: <a href="">What if I don't carry a laptop around?</a></span></li>

      <p>This product is meant for folks who can type fast, spend most of the time near a computer, and prefer typing over mouse/voice commands. Therefore, <mark>Command Line Interface (CLI) is the primary mode of input.</mark> The GUI is primarily for output.
        That is, the GUI is used to give visual feedback rather than to collect input. Some minimal use of mouse is OK (e.g. to click the minimize button), but the primary input should be CLI-driven. Mouse actions should have keyboard alternatives and
        typing a command is preferred over key combinations. Design the app in a way that you can do stuff faster by typing compared to mouse or key combinations.</p>

      <p>Here are the allowed options for enhancing AddressBook:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>[Highly recommended] Rename the product to a more catchy name.</li>
        <li>Add more features related to managing contacts.</li>
        <li>Enhance existing features. <span class="dimmed">e.g. make the <code>find</code> feature more powerful</span></li>
        <li>Make the command syntax more user friendly <span class="dimmed">e.g. allow more variations of the keywords</span></li>
        <li>Add features that allows managing things other than contacts. <span class="dimmed">e.g. todo items, appointments, deadlines, etc.</span></li>
        <li>Modify the internal design <span class="dimmed">e.g. change the architecture</span></li>
        <li>Modify the GUI design</li>
        <li>Integrate with online services <span class="dimmed">e.g. Google contacts, Facebook, GitHub, etc.</span></li>
        <li>Incorporate more useful tools/libraries/frameworks into the product or the project workflow <span class="dimmed">(e.g. automate more aspects of the project workflow using a GitHub plugin)</span></li>

      <p>Each student is expected to <mark>contribute one or more enhancements <strong>individually</strong></mark>.</p>

      <ul>
        <li>{to be added}</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Each enhancement should be stand-alone but should fit with the rest of the software and should have the consent of the team members.</p>
      <p>A student's contribution should be incremental, over at least three releases of the product. It should be be one in one big burst.</p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <p><strong>Constraint-Morph</strong>: The final product should be a result of morphing the given sample code. i.e. enhance and/or evolve the given code to arrive at the new software. However, you are allowed to replace all existing code with new
            code, as long as it is done incrementally. <span class="dimmed">e.g. one feature/component at a time</span><br><span class="dimmed"><strong>Reason:</strong> To ensure your code has a decent quality level from the start.</span></p>

        </li>
        <li>

      <p>Get together with your team members and brainstorm user stories <strong>for the v3.0 of the product</strong>. Note that in the project you will deliver only up to v2.5.</p>
      <panel header="%%User Story examples (from a different product)%%">

      <ul>
        <li>It is ok to have more user stories than you can deliver in the project.You should have at least 30 user stories. Include all 'obvious' ones you can think of but also look for 'non obvious' ones that you think are likely to be missed by other teams.</li>
        <li>Write each use story in a piece of paper (e.g. yellow sticky note, index card, or just pieces of paper about the size of a playing card). Alternatively you can use an online tool such as Trello for recording the initial collection of user stories.</li>
        <li>Note that <mark>you should not 'evaluate' the value of user stories while doing the above</mark>. An important aspect of brainstorming is not judging the ideas generated.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3 id="step-2-prioritize-the-user-stories">Step 2: Prioritize the user stories</h3><img src="/cs2103-website/handbook/images/userstories.png" width="250px">
      <p>Suggested workflow:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>Take one use story at a time and get team member opinions about it.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Based on the team consensus, put the story (i.e. the piece of paper) onto one of these three piles:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><code>Must-Have</code> : The product will be practically useless without this feature.</li>
            <li><code>Nice-To-Have</code> : The target user can benefit from this user story significantly but you are not certain if you'll have time to implement it.</li>
            <li><code>Not-Useful</code> : No significant benefit to the target use.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>After all stories have been put in the above three piles, you can make a record of which stories are in the three piles.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Here are some tips to improve the effectiveness of the above activity:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Define the target user:</strong><br> Decide our target user's work patterns. e.g. Does he work in groups or alone? Does he share his computer with others? (answer: no). Having a clear picture of the target user's work patterns will help
          when deciding the importance of a user story.</li>
        <li><strong>Don't be biased by the implementation plans:</strong><br> This exercise is for identifying user needs. Clear your mind of ideas you have about what your product will look like. Assume that you do not know yet what product you will build.</li>
        <li><strong>Don't discuss implementation details or whether you are actually going to implement it:</strong><br> At this point, your decision is whether the user's need is important enough for you to want to fulfil it. Implementation details can be
          discussed later. If a user story in the Nice-To-Have pile turn out to be too difficult to implement later, you can always not implement it.</li>
        <li><strong>Don't be too hasty to discard 'unusual' user stories:</strong><br> Those might make your product unique and stand out from the rest, at least for some potential users.</li>
        <li><strong>Don't go into too much details when sorting user stories:</strong><br> For example, consider this user story:
          <ul>
            <li>As a user, I want to see a list of tasks that needs my attention most at the present time, so that I pay attention to them first.*<br> When discussing this user story, you do not need to worry about what tasks should be considered 'needs my
              attention most at the present time'. Those details can be worked out later.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3 id="step-3-survey-existing-products">Step 3: Survey existing products</h3>
      <p>See how well existing products meet Jim's needs.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>Select a few competing products to study. Each person should study at least one existing product. Identify strengths and weaknesses of the product w.r.t. how well it can cater for Jim’s requirements.</p>
          <p>Here are some popular 'task manager' type products out there you can consider exploring (you are not limited to these): Google Calendar + Google Tasks | <a href="https://hitask.com">HiTask</a> | <a href="https://www.rememberthemilk.com/">Remember The Milk</a>            | <a href="http://todotxt.com/">Todo.txt</a> | <a href="https://todoist.com/">Todoist</a> | <a href="https://trello.com/">Trello</a> | Microsoft Outlook | <a href="https://www.wunderlist.com/">Wunderlist</a></p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><strong>Note</strong>: Don’t get discouraged if an existing product meets Jim’s needs quite well. We are trying to learn SE, not sell a product.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>After looking at existing products, you may want to go back and revise some of the user stories.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3 id="step-4-conceptualize-the-product-as-a-user-guide">Step 4: Conceptualize the product as a user guide</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Based on your user story categorization in step 1 and given project requirements (note that the project requirements specify some must-have features), select which user stories you are likely to include in V0.5.</li>
        <li>Based on the user stories you selected above, specify the product you are going to build, in the form of a user guide. Yes, strangely enough, in this project we draft the user guide before we build the product. This will help you/us visualize
          the final product before you start implementing it.</li>
        <li><mark>Remember to take into account the UI design and the functionalities available in AddressBook Level 4</mark>. As you will be using that software as the starting point of your implementation, it makes sense to align your product with it (within
          reason) to minimize the implementation effort.</li>
        <li>Remember to include the exact command format because it is the core part of your UI.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Use the documentation in the sample project as an example. Given below are pages to update.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p><strong>User guide</strong>:<br> Describe what the product would be like when it is submitted at the end of the semester. Starting from the time user starts using the product for the first time, describe how the user uses the product to accomplish
            various tasks.<br> Here are some ‘quick start guides’ you can look at for inspiration when writing your user guide:<br><a href="https://github.com/se-edu/collate/blob/master/docs/User-Guide.md">Collate project</a>, <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-sg/HT202033">iPhone :How to get started</a>,
            <a href="https://teammatesv4.appspot.com/instructorHelp.jsp#gs">TEAMMATES (for instructors)</a><br> Use UI prototypes/sketches if necessary. They can be simple sketches drawn on whiteboard/paper and scanned/photographed or created using a
            tool such as PowerPoint, HTML, or <a href="https://balsamiq.com/">Balasmiq</a>.<br> State what you honestly believe you can do, based on information you have at this point. You will not be penalized if you cannot deliver what you proposed
            to deliver. It is OK to tweak the project scope along the way.<br><mark>Specify the command format in detail</mark> as it is an important part of the product functionality.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><strong>Developer guide</strong>: Update the following appendices.</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>User Stories</strong>: Give a list of the user stories, including priorities. This can include user stories considered but will not be included in the final product.</li>
            <li><strong>Use cases</strong>: Give use cases (textual form) for a few representative user stories that need multiple steps to complete. e.g.
              <ul>
                <li>Rescheduling a task, which may require two steps: locating the task first and then updating it.</li>
                <li>Checking a day's schedule at the end of the day: requires filtering the day's tasks, marking complete tasks as done, and rescheduling or deleting remaining tasks.</li>
                <li>Finding something to do where here is a free time.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Non-functional requirements</strong>:<br> Note: User stories capture functional requirements. What are the non-functional requirements of your project? Many of the project constraints mentioned above are NFRs. You can add more. e.g.
              performance requirements, usability requirements, scalability requirements, etc.</li>
            <li><strong>Glossary</strong>: Define terms that are worth defining.</li>
            <li><strong>Product survey</strong>: Describe a summary of the product survey. i.e. Pros, cons, (from Jim's point of view). Each student should document the product they explored. If multiple students have explored the same product, you may have
              to explore more products to complete this section.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Suggested length</strong>: Take the sample project as a baseline.</p>
      <p><strong>Submission</strong>: Update the relevant sections of the relevant markdown documents (i.e. <code>UserGuide.md, DeveloperGuide.md</code>) in your repo. <a href="http://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Tagging">git tag</a> as <code>V0.0</code>.</p>
      <p><strong>Grading</strong>: Reaching this milestone (and future milestones) will be counted under 'Project management' component of the final project grade.<br> To claim this milestone as 'reached', you should at least have a full draft version of
        the above documents in some format (e.g. GoogleDoc), even if you didn't have time to update the markdown documents in the repo.</p>

      <p><strong>Submission</strong>: Push the code to GitHub and <a href="http://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Tagging">git tag</a> as <code>V0.1</code>. Refer to the Schedule page for further submission instructions.</p>
      <p><strong>Grading</strong>: To consider this milestone as reached, you should have at least add/delete/find support for floating tasks. You should be able to do that by deleting/renaming the given Address Book code, without having to add too much
        new code.<br> The most important thing is not to break the code while morphing sample code to your target product.</p>

            Roles imply aspects you are in charge of and responsible for. E.g., if you are in charge of documentation, you are the person who should allocate who should write which part, ensure the document is in right format, ensure consistency etc. Here are some
            typical roles:
            <ul>
              <li><em>Team lead</em>: Responsible for overall project coordination.</li>
              <li><em>Documentation</em> (short for ‘in charge of documentation’): Responsible for the quality of various project documents.</li>
              <li><em>Testing</em>: Ensures the testing of the project is done properly and on time.</li>
              <li><em>Code quality</em>: Looks after code quality, ensures adherence to coding standards, etc.</li>
              <li><em>Deliverables and deadlines</em>: Ensure project deliverables are done on time and in the right format.</li>
              <li><em>Integration</em>: In charge of versioning of the code, maintaining the code repository, integrating various parts of the software to create a whole.</li>
              <li><em>Scheduling and tracking</em>: In charge of defining, assigning, and tracking project tasks.</li>
              <li><em>[Tool ABC] expert</em>: e.g. Eclipse expert, Git expert, etc. Helps other team member with matters related to the specific tool.</li>
              <li><em>In charge of[Component XYZ]</em>: e.g. In charge of Model, GUI, Storage, etc. If you are in charge of a component, you are expected to know that component well, do the initial refactoring of the component (during V0.1 and V0.2) and review
                changes done to that component in V0.3-V0.5.</li>
              <li>You may define additional roles.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Please make sure each of the above roles are assigned to one person in the team. It is OK to have a ‘backup’ for each role, but you should still have one person who is unequivocally the main person playing that role.</p>

          <p><mark>It should be a viable, possibly minimal product</mark>. This is not a walking skeleton. A user should be able to use it. It may not be user-friendly, but it should not be unusable. Try to include at least the basic CRUD facilities for
            at least one type of tasks. Here are some examples that are NOT acceptable:</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>example 1. Has a well-developed functionality to add tasks but does not support commands for deleting or editing tasks: This is not usable because the user cannot rectify errors made while creating tasks.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>example 2. Has all the CRUD functionality implemented but they are not connected to the UI: This too is not usable by the end-user.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>While this is an internal release (not a production release), <mark>you are expected to maintain a reasonable code quality at all times</mark>. In particular, you should comply with the coding standard all the time.</p>

      <h3 id="v02-documentation">V0.2 Documentation</h3>
      <p>You are encouraged to update your project documentation to match the product but you are not required to submit them for evaluation. Note that this flexibility is given solely to reduce your workload. In a production environment, the documentation

      <p>This version should be a more functional version than V0.2 and should contain at least a basic version of features you intend to release in the final version.</p>
      <p>Ideally, V0.3 should be good enough for <a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=dogfooding%20(to%20dogfood)">dog fooding</a>. Try to reach a dogfooding-ready version of the 'must have' features at least.</p>
      <p>From V0.3, <mark>you are required to divide work based on features</mark> rather than component. That is, each team member should implement 0 or more features end-to-end, doing required changes in <em>all</em> components. The objective of this switch
        is to force you to learn all components of the software, instead of limiting yourself to your own components.<br> Note that you will continue to be in charge of your own components although others will be modifying your components' code. Your
        new role is to help others modify code in your components (you are supposed to be the most knowledgeable about those components) and protect your components from degrading. For example, you can review others' changes to your components and suggest
        possible changes. This is also a good time to switch to a PR based workflow (if you haven't done that already) as PRs can be reviewed by other team members before merging.</p>
      <p><strong>Submission</strong>: V0.3 (and future milestones) <mark>should be released using GitHub's release mechanism</mark>. The release should include an executable JAR file. Refer the <a href="https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY1617S2/addressbook-level4/blob/master/docs/DeveloperGuide.md#making-a-release">'Making a Release' section of the sample developer guide</a>        for more info.</p>
      <p><strong>Grading</strong>: To pass this checkpoint, your product should be noticeably better than an MVP. It goes without saying that other project management requirements expected at reaching a milestone (mentioned in the <a href="#using-milestones">'Using Milestones' section of Appendix E</a>)
        are applicable too.</p>

      <p>Follow the documentation in the sample project in terms or organization, level of details, etc.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>User Guide</strong>: Update User Guide to match what you plan to deliver at V0.5</li>
        <li><strong>Developer Guide</strong>: Update Developer Guide to match your current design or the design you plan to have at V0.5.<br> [1] While it is OK for some sections to be written collectively, <mark>each student should have some sections that were written individually</mark>.
          For example, the section describing the design of Logic component should be written by the person in charge of the Logic component.<br> [2] It is <mark>not enough to simply do minor tweaks to the existing document</mark> to match your project
          if your design is very similar to the sample given. We need to see a significant amount of content written by each student to judge how well you can document technical details and use relevant models.<br> Here are some things you can add:
          <ul>
            <li>Compare the current design with other alternative designs possible.</li>
            <li>Add more descriptions e.g. show at least one interaction within each component.</li>
            <li>Use object diagrams to show sample object structures at runtime (if it helps the reader).</li>
            <li>Explain how you implemented complicated features such as undo/redo.</li>
            <li>In future (after these topics have been covered):
              <ul>
                <li>Use Activity Diagrams and OO Domain Models where applicable.</li>

The code up to the next <code>//@@author</code> tag or the end of the file (whichever comes first) will be considered as was written by that author.<br>            However, you may put an empty <code>//@@author</code> (i.e. no matric number) to indicate the end of the code segment you wrote, if you don't know who wrote the code segment below yours. The author of that code segment can add the matric number
            to the empty tag later.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>If a method was written by more than one person, the <code>//@@author</code> tag should indicate the person who wrote most of that method. i.e., <code>//@@author</code> tag should not appear inside a method.<br> If some part of the code was
            done collectively, you should still divide it up to reflect the amount of work each person contributed. For example, if 3 people wrote 150 lines of code and put in equal effort in doing so, you can divide the methods among yourselves roughly
            50 lines to each person. Once a code segment is allocated to one person, that person is responsible (and will be graded for) the quality of that code. If parts of that code was written by someone else and those parts are not of high quality,
            the designated author should refactor the code to make it high quality.<br> Tip: GitHub has a 'blame' feature and a 'history' feature that can help you determine who wrote a piece of code.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Do not put the <code>//@@author</code> inside java header comments as only the content below that tag will be collated.</p>
          <pre class="hljs"><code>/**
  * Returns true if ...
  * @@author A0909865T
  */
</code></pre>
          <pre class="hljs"><code>//@@author A0909865T
/**
  * Returns true if ...
  */
</code></pre>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>If you wrote a significant amount of code that was not used in the final product,</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Create a folder called <code>{project root}/unused</code></li>
            <li>Move unused files to that folder (those files should contain unused code only)</li>
            <li>use <code>//@@author matric-number</code> to mark unused code in those files.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>e.g.</p>
          <pre class="hljs"><code>//@@author A0909865T-unused
method 1 ...
method 2 ...
</code></pre>
          <p>Please put a comment in the code to explain why it was not used.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>The <code>//@@author</code> tag should be used to mark <em>all</em> code/test you claim credit for. There is no need to mark documentation files.<br> You will be penalized if you try to boost the length of your collated files using unethical
            means such as duplicating the same code in multiple places. In particular, do not copy-paste test cases to create redundant tests. Even repetitive code blocks within test methods should be extracted out as utility methods to reduce code duplication.<br>            Individual members are responsible for making sure their own collated files contain the correct content.<br> If you notice a team member claiming credit for code that he/she did not write, you can email us (after the final submission) to let
            us know.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p><strong>INCLUDE</strong>: everything that required significant ‘writing’ effort. e.g. comments, test code, styling (e.g. css), xml, even test data files. But do not include chunks of text that were trivially copy pasted e.g. a test data
                file with 1000 tasks that was used to test performance.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p><strong>Code you reused</strong> from elsewhere: Mark such code as <code>//@@author matric-number-reused</code></p>
              <p>e.g.</p>
              <pre class="hljs"><code>//@@author A0909865T-reused
method 1 ...
method 2 ...
</code></pre>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p><strong>EXCLUDE</strong> code generated by the IDE/framework. You may also mark such code <code>//@@author generated</code></p>
              <p>e.g.</p>
              <pre class="hljs"><code>//@@author generated
method 1 ...

            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>You need to put the,</p>
          <ul>
            <li>collated functional code in <code>collated/main</code> folder,</li>
            <li>collated test code in <code>collated/test</code> folder, and</li>
            <li>collated unused code in <code>collated/unused</code> folder</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Given below are DOS sample commands you can put in a batch file and run it to collate the code.</p>
          <pre class="hljs"><code>java -jar Collate-TUI.jar collate from src/main to collated/main include java, fxml, css

        <li>It is a 'sitting down' demo: As before, you'll be demonstrating the features using the TV while sitting down.</li>
        <li>Tutor will not interrupt you during the demo. That means you should finish within the given time.</li>
        <li>It should be done by 2 members (i.e. one person do the first half, the other do the 2nd half).<br> If you are not taking part in this demo, you must take part in V0.5 demo.<br> One or more persons can do the typing for the whole demo. Speaking
          should be done by the two designated to do the demo.</li>
        <li>The app should be populated with a significant amount of realistic data at the start. e.g data going back to at least two weeks and up to two weeks in future, about 50 items in total.</li>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Venue:</strong> Same as the tutorial venue.</li>
        <li><strong>Duration:</strong> Strictly no more than 12 minutes. Exceeding this limit will be penalized.</li>
        <li><strong>Schedule:</strong> Your demo timing is same as your tutorial time in week 13.<br> Starting times: <code>Team B1: 00 minutes, B2: 15 minutes, B3: 30 minutes, B4: 45 minutes</code><br> At least some team members need to arrive 15 minutes

        <li><strong>Target audience</strong>: Assume you are giving a demo to a higher-level manager of your company, to brief him/her on the current capabilities of the product.<br> The scenarios you demonstrate should be chosen judiciously so that you cover
          the full range of your product's functionality. Give more time to stronger features (i.e. cover mundane/basic features fast). It is recommended you showcase how the product improves the user’s workflow rather than simply describe each feature.<br>          No need to cover design/implementation details as the manager is not interested in those details.</li>
        <li><strong>Dress code</strong> : The level of formality is up to you, but it is recommended that the whole team dress at the same level.</li>
        <li><strong>Testing:</strong> All team member should remain in the holding area during the tutorial slot (when you are not doing the demo) because our testers might need to communicate with you during the testing.<br> Holding area for Active Learning
          Room: Unused area of the room (enter by the door near the staircase)<br> Holding area for SR5: Tables outside SR5</li>
        <li><strong>Structure:</strong><br> Demo the product using the same executable you submitted, on your own laptop, using the TV.<br> Every team member should take part in the demo. However, it's ok for one member to do all the typing.</li>
        <li><strong>Optimizing the time:</strong><br> Try to make the maximum use of the short demo time in the following ways,
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>Spend as much time as possible on demonstrating the actual product. Not recommended to use slides (if you do, use them sparingly) or videos or lengthy narrations.<br> Avoid skits, re-enactments, dramatizations etc. This is not a sales pitch
                or an informercial. While you need to show how a user use the product to get value, but you don’t need to act like an imaginary user. For example, [Instead of this]<code>Jim get’s a call from boss. &quot;Ring ring&quot;, &quot;hello&quot;, &quot;oh hi Jim, can we postpone the meeting?&quot; &quot;Sure&quot;. Jim hang up and curses the boss under his breath. Now he starts typing ..etc.</code><br>                [do this] <code>If Jim needs to postpone the meeting, he can type …</code><br> It’s not that dramatization is bad or we don’t like it. We simply don’t have enough time for it.<br> Note that CS2101 demo requirements may differ. Different
                context → Different requirements.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Rehearse the steps well and ensure you can do a smooth demo. <mark>Demos that are clearly under-prepared will be penalized.</mark></p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>If you are not deft with using the laptop’s touchpad, please bring a mouse.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Don’t waste time repeating things the target audience already knows. Assume the target audience knows that the product is a task manager targeting Jim-like users. That means no need to explain those things again.<br> Also assume the target
                audience knows who you are. That means no need to say things like &quot;We are students from NUS, SoC&quot;.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Bring sufficient amount of sample data and know how to load them to the system. You should not plan to type all the sample data during the demo itself. On the other hand, trying to demo a product using just a couple of sample tasks creates
                a bad impression too.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Plan the demo to be in sync with the impression you want to create. For example, if you are trying to convince that the product is easy to use, show the easiest way to enter a task before you show the full command with all the bells and
                whistles.</p>

    <div>
      <p>Note that project grading is <mark>not competitive (not bell curved)</mark>. <mark>CS2103T projects will be assessed separately from CS2103 projects.</mark> This is to account for the perceived difference in workload. Given below is the marking
        scheme.</p>
      <p><strong>Total</strong>: 50 marks (25 individual marks + 25 team marks)</p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p><strong>Product features</strong> [team][10 marks] - How good is your software as a product?</p>
          <p>Based on the features implemented, how well they fit together to make a good product, and how well they are demonstrated.</p>
          <p>‘Half-baked’ (i.e. not production quality) or 'ill-fitting' (feature does not go well with the other features) features will not earn marks at all and could even be penalized. It may be better to remove such features before submission.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><strong>Design</strong> [individual][5 marks] - How good is your internal design?</p>
          <p>Evaluated <mark>solely based on what we can learn from the developer guide.</mark> Evaluated by lecturer. You will be graded individually on the design of your component and how well you have described it. Collective design decisions such as
            architecture will affect the grade of all team members.</p>
          <p>Criteria considered:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Conformance with the multi-level top-down approach (i.e. design at high-level first, and do the lower-level design of each component later)</li>
            <li>Conformance with the OO paradigm</li>
            <li>Application of patterns and principles</li>
            <li>Quality of documentation e.g. using the right diagram at the right place.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><strong>Implementation</strong> [individual][15 marks] - How good is your implementation? A measure of the <mark>quality and the quantity</mark> of code you have written yourself. On average, a student is expected to write 0.5-1.5 KLoC. Evaluated
            based on an inspection of the collated code (submitted in your *.md files) by at least two tutors.<br> Criteria considered:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Following SLAP (IMPORTANT).</li>
            <li>Following the coding standard given (IMPORTANT).</li>
            <li>Using at least some assertions.</li>
            <li>Using at least some logging.</li>
            <li>Using at least some unit tests.</li>
            <li>Commenting at the right level.</li>
            <li>Exception handling.</li>
            <li>Neatness and human readability.Expectations:</li>
            <li>Each person is expected to implement one or more features individually in addition to features implemented collectively. Each person is expected to write backend code, frontend code, test code, user documentation, and developer documentation.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><strong>QA</strong> [team: 5 marks], [individual: 5 marks] - How good is your Quality Assurance? Evaluated based on our own testing. A well written user guide and a product that conforms to the user guide (i.e. no bugs) will give you a high
            mark.</p>
          <p>Things considered for team grade: Bugs including validation issues (i.e. not meeting project requirements)</p>
          <p>Things considered for individual grade: Quality and quantity of the test code in your collated code.</p>
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>Expectations:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>There is no requirement for a minimum coverage level. Note that in a production environment you are often required to have at least 90% of the code covered by tests. In this project, it can be less.</li>
        <li>How much of each type of testing should you do? We expect you to decide. You learned different types of testing and what they try to achieve. Based on that, you should decide how much of each type is required. Similarly, you can decide to what
          extent you want to automate tests, depending on the benefits and the effort required.</li>
        <li>Applying TDD is optional. If you plan to test something, it is better to apply TDD because TDD ensures that you write functional code in a testable way. If you do it the normal way, you often find that it is hard to test the functional code because
          the code has low testability.</li>

        id="giving-peer-feedback">
        <p>Giving constructive feedback to others is a valuable skill for software engineers. It is also an intended learning outcome of this module. <mark>Those who give ineffective feedback will be penalized.</mark></p>
        <p>Here are some things to keep in mind:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Assume you are giving feedback to a colleague, not a friend. Keep the tone of your feedback reasonably professional. Do not use offensive language or slang.</li>
          <li>The feedback should be honest and consistent. Giving positive qualitative feedback (e.g. <code>Thanks for all the hard work!</code> and negative ratings (e.g. <code>Equal share - 40%</code>) to the same team member is not being honest.</li>
          <li>State your expectations early. All too often students give positive/neutral feedback early (hoping that the team member will improve later) and trash the team member in the final evaluation (because the he/she did not improve as expected). However,
            this could be confusing to the recipient. It is better to give negative feedback early so that the team member gets a clear signal that he/she needs to improve.</li>
        </ul>
        </span>
        <p>The final peer evaluation will be used to determine the level of contribution from each member to the project. In that peer-evaluation you will be asked to <mark>estimate the contribution of each team member</mark> (including yourself) to the
          project so far.</p><img src="/cs2103-website/handbook/images/peer evaluations.png" width="70%">
        <p><mark>Final peer evaluation affects your grade</mark>in the following way:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>If there is a general consensus about how much each one contributed, we award grades based on the contribution levels submitted through the peer evaluation. i.e., if everyone agrees you did more than others, you get more marks.</li>
          <li>If there are significant discrepancies in the peer evaluations (e.g., you say you did an [equal share + 20%] while your team says you did an [equal share - 10%]), we will investigate further before finalizing project marks. For such teams, we
            are likely to request some or all members to <mark>submit an additional individual report</mark> to itemize and quantify the contribution to the project. <mark>Overclaimers will be penalized.</mark> Please do not claim high just to ‘see how’.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Peer evaluations are <mark>not visible to undergraduate tutors.</mark></p>
        <p><mark>If you disagree with the team’s opinion</mark>, i.e., you think the perceived contribution is significantly different from what you actually contributed, you can help us grade you fairly by submitting an individual report (‘individual report’
          is explained under V0.5 deliverables).</p>
        <p>Keep in mind the contribution numbers reported by TEAMMATES are based on team member perceptions and may not reflect your real contribution. <mark>We use those numbers primarily to identify cases that need further investigation.</mark></p>
        <p>You may <mark>ignore minor variations</mark> in the contribution numbers reported by TEAMMATES. For example, the difference between [Equal share] and [Equal share - 2%] is not significant and can very well be due to rounding off within the system.</p>
        <p>Also keep in mind that it is human nature for one to downplay the value of contributions from others when one’s own contribution is being compared to that of others. As a result, it is common for the ‘perceived contribution’ to be somewhat lower
          than what you actually did.</p>
        <p>If you are unhappy about the peer-feedback received and would like to make your views known to the team, please allow at least one day to lapse before you fire off a response email. You are likely to respond more rationally when you had some time
          to think it over. Also keep in mind that we do take note of how well you handle such a situation. You need to act professionally when facing conflicting views, opposition, and even deliberate sabotage.</p>

      <p><strong>Communication</strong>:</p>
      <p>Keeping a record of communications among your team can help you, and us, in many ways. We encourage you to do at least some of the project communication in written medium (e.g., GitHub Issue Tracker) to practice how to communicate technical things
        in written form.</p>
      <p><strong>Collaboration platform</strong>: We are going to <mark>use GitHub as the hosting and collaboration platform</mark> of your project (i.e., to hold the Code repository, Issue Tracker, etc.). See <a href="#handbook-appendixE-github">Appendix E</a>        for more info on how to setup and use GitHub for your project.</p>
      <p><strong>IDE</strong>: We <mark>require you to use <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/">Eclipse</a></mark> (latest stable release) for module related programming work. Because all team members will work on the same code base and project tutors
        too have to go through the code for testing and evaluation, it is troublesome to use multiple IDEs. Furthermore, when everyone uses the same tool, it creates a bigger collective know-how about the tool which makes troubleshooting easier and the
        productivity higher.</p>
      <p><strong>Revision control</strong>:</p>
      <p>You are required to use Git. Other revision control software are not allowed.<br> The recommended GUI client for Git is <a href="https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/">SourceTree</a> (which comes bundled with Git), but you may use any other, or none.</p>

        <li>Study tips:
          <ul>
            <li>Go through the worked examples in handouts.</li>

        in tutorials(tutorials too are focused on application of theory to the project), and do a sincere job in the project. <mark>You will not be able to ace the exams by simply doing past papers just before the exams.</mark></p><img src="/cs2103-website/handbook/images/exam connected to project.png"

      <p><strong>[ You . Together . Continuously . Reach ]</strong></p>
      <p>These are some of the main principles underlying the module structure.</p>
      <p>The product is you, NOT what you build.</p>
      <p>The software product you build is a side effect only. You are the product of this module. This means,</p>

        <li>We may not take the most efficient route to building the software product. We take the route that allows you to learn the most.</li>
        <li>Building a software product that is unique, creative, and shiny is not our priority (although we try to do a bit of that too). Learning to take pride in, and discovering the joy of, high quality software engineering work is our priority.</li>

      <p>Following from that, we evaluate you on not just how much you've done, but also, how well you've done those things.</p>

      <p><strong>Continuously engage, NOT last minute heroics.</strong></p>
      <p>We want to train you to do software engineering in a steady and repeatable manner that does not require 'last minute heroics'.</p>
      <p>In this module, last minute heroics will not earn you a good project grade, and last minute mugging will not earn you a good exam grade.</p>
      <p><strong>Where you reach at the end matters, NOT what you knew at the beginning.</strong></p>
      <p>When you start the module, some others in the class may appear to know a lot more than you. Don't let that worry you. The final grade depends on what you know at the end, not what you knew to begin with. The full 10% allocated to intermediate deliverables
        is within the reach of everyone in the class irrespective of their prior knowledge.</p>

      <div id="policy-followingInstructions">
        <p>When working with others, especially in a large class such as CS2103,  it is very important that you adhere to standards, policies, and instructions imposed on everyone. Not doing so creates unnecessary headaches for everyone and sends negative
          signals about your work attitude. That is why we deduct participation points for not following instructions carefully.</p>

      <h3 id="policy-on-grading-smallerlarger-teams">Policy on grading smaller/larger teams</h3>
      <div id="policy-teamSize">
        <p>We do take team size into account when grading.</p>
        <p>3 member teams are allowed to do slightly less than 4 member teams (i.e., 10-15% less) and 5 member teams are expected to slightly more than 4 member teams (i.e., 10-15% more). The variation of expected output is less than 25% (although the variation
          in team size is 25%). This is to account for the fact that extra people adds to the communication overhead.</p>

      <h3 id="policy-on-project-work-distribution">Policy on project work distribution</h3>
      <div id="policy-workDistribution">
        <p>It is OK to do less or more than equal share in your project team. However, be prepared to receive a different grade than your team members if you didn't do an equal share.</p>
        <p>Everyone is expected to do a write back-end code, frontend code, tests, user documentation, and developer documentation. If you limit yourself to tasks like documentation only, you are likely to fail the project component.</p>

        <p>There is no need to inform us. If you miss a lecture/tutorial for a valid reason, just do your best to catch up. We'll be happy to help if required. An occasional absence or two is not expected to affect your participation marks. <br> Only if
          you fail to earn full marks for participation we will consider giving an alternative avenue to earn marks missed due to the absences.</p>

      <h3 id="policy-on-email-response-time">Policy on email response time</h3>
      <div id="policy-responseTime">
        <p><mark>I will respond to you within 24 hours</mark> if it was an email sent to me or a forum post directed at me. If you don't get a response within that time, <mark>please feel free to remind me</mark>. It is likely that I did not notice your
          post or the email got stuck somewhere.</p>
        <p>Similarly I expect you to check email regularly and respond to emails written to you personally (not mass email) promptly.</p>
        <panel header="**Email etiquette: ALWAYS respond to direct emails**" expandable="">
          <p>Not responding to a personal email is a major breach of professional etiquette (and general civility). Imagine how pissed off you would be if you met me along the corridor, said 'Hi Damith, good morning' and I walked away without saying anything
            back. Not responding to a personal email is just as bad. Always take a few seconds to at least acknowledge such emails.  It doesn't take long to type &quot;Noted. Thanks&quot; and hit 'send'.</p>
          <p>The promptness of a reply is even more important when the email is requesting you for something that you cannot provide. Imagine you wrote to me requesting a reference letter and I did not respond at all because I didn't want to give you one;
            You'll be quite frustrated because you wouldn't know whether to look for another professor or wait longer for my response. Saying 'No' is fine and in fact a necessary part of professional life; but saying nothing is not acceptable. If you
            didn't reply, the sender will not even know whether you received the email.</p>

      <div id="policy-plagiarism">
        <p>What's allowed:</p>
        <p>We encourage sharing, but you should share with everyone in the class, not just a selected group. That is,</p>
        <ul>
          <li>You are not allowed to share individual assignments with classmates directly.</li>
          <li>You are not allowed to share project-related things with other teams directly.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>However, note that most submissions will be published to the class after the submission deadline, after which they <mark>can be 'reused' by others</mark> subject to the 'reuse policy' given below.</p>
        <p>If you submit code taken from elsewhere, you need to comply with our reuse policy.</p>
        <p>Detection:</p>
        <p>Detecting plagiarism in code is quite easy. You are not fooling anyone by reordering code or renaming methods/variables. Besides, all your submissions are published to the class and sooner or later somebody will notice the plagiarism.</p>
        <p>Penalties:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>For activities earning participation marks: We make a record of cases of plagiarism but we do not take further action. Because participation marks are given for effort and all students can earn the full marks easily, such plagiarism does not
            disadvantage other students. Therefore, we prefer to spend all available resources on helping honest students to do better rather than to chase after dishonest students. If you think you gain something by plagiarizing, go ahead and do it.
            It's your choice and it's your loss.</li>
          <li>For the final project/exam: Any case of claiming others' work as yours will be reported to the university for disciplinary action.</li>

          Rather, you will be given credit for using work done by others.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>You are allowed to reuse work from your classmates, subject to following conditions:

              <li>The work comes from a source of 'good standing' (such as an established open source project). This means you cannot reuse code written by an outside 'friend'.</li>
              <li>You clearly give credit to the original author. Acknowledge use of third party resources clearly e.g. in the welcome message, splash screen (if any) or under the 'about' menu. If you are open about reuse, you are less likely to get into
                trouble if you unintentionally reused something copyrighted.</li>

      <div id="handbook-faq-highWorkload"><img src="/cs2103-website/handbook/images/Why workload heavy.png" width="378" height="340">
        <p>CS2103/T prepares you for many higher-level project modules (CS3216/7, CS3201/2, CS3281/2/3/4, CG3002, etc.), each requiring a slightly different skill set. It is also the only SE course some of you do before going for industry internships. Therefore,
          we have to cover many essential SE concepts/skills and also provide enough exercises for you to practice those skills. This is also why we don't have time to go very deep into any of the topics.</p>
        <p>Remember, everything you learn here is going to be useful in a SE-related career.</p>
        <p>Also, consider this a gradual introduction to 'heavy' modules; most project modules you do after this are going to be much heavier :-p</p>
        <p><mark>How to reduce the workload?</mark> There are many activities worth only bonus points and there are other optional activities that you can omit to reduce workload. Those activities are useful only if you are aiming for a high-end SE career,
          CS2103 tutorships, recommendation letters from the module lecturer, to enroll in selective modules (e.g. CS3216/7), etc.</p>

      <div id="handbook-faq-beanCounting"><img src="/cs2103-website/handbook/images/small things matter.png" width="600" height="300">
        <p>Sometimes, small things matter in big ways. e.g., all other things being equal, a job may be offered to the candidate who has the neater looking CV although both have the same qualifications. This may be unfair, but that's how the world works.
          Students forget this harsh reality when they are in the protected environment of the school and tend to get sloppy with their work habits. That is why we reward all positive behavior, even small ones (e.g., following precise submission instructions,
          arriving on time etc.).</p>
        <p>But unlike the real world, we are forgiving. That is why you can still earn full 10 marks of the participation marks even if you miss a few things here and there.</p>

        <p>We have a separate website because some of the module information does not fit into the structure imposed by IVLE.</p>
        <p>On a related note, keep in mind that 'hunting and gathering' of relevant information is one of the skills you need to survive 'in the wild'. Do not always expect all relevant materials to appear 'magically' in some kind of 'work bin'.</p>
        <p>Furthermore, unlike IVLE, a copy of the module website <mark>will remain online</mark> at <a href="http://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~cs2103/AY1617S2/">http://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~cs2103/AY1617S2/</a> for your reference for the next few years.</p>

        <p>Slides are not meant to be documents to print and study for exams. Their purpose is to support the lecture delivery and keep you engaged during the lecture. That's why our slides are less detailed and more visual.</p>
        <p>Handouts are wordy because they are reference materials for you to study at your own pace and use during the module and later. The format is similar to materials (books, online articles, etc.) you will have to refer to when you work in the industry.
          They too are not meant to be cheat sheets 'to study for exams with minimal effort'.</p>

      <div id="handbook-faq-selfStudy"><img src="/cs2103-website/handbook/images/so much self study.png" width="763" height="307">
        <p>Self-study is a critical survival skill in SE industry. Lectures will show you the way, but absorbing content is to be done at your own pace, by yourself. In this module, we still tell you what content to study and also pass most of the content
          to you. After you graduate, you have to decide what to study and find your own content too.</p>

      <h3 id="why-do-i-have-to-come-to-tutorials-on-time">Why do I have to come to tutorials on time?</h3>
      <div id="handbook-faq-timelyArrival">

        <p>Reason: You enjoy the benefits of not bring the laptop; you should bear the cost too</p>
      </div>
      <h3 id="why-very-narrow-project-scope">Why very narrow project scope?</h3>
      <div id="handbook-faq-narrowScope">
        <p>Defining your own unique project is more fun.</p>
        <p>But, wider scope → more diverse projects → harder for us to go deep into your project. The collective know-how we (i.e., students and the teaching team) build up about SE issues related to the project become shallow and stretched too thinly. It
          also affects fairness of grading.</p><img src="/cs2103-website/handbook/images/limited project scope.png" width="772" height="296">
        <p>That is why a strictly-defined project is more suitable for a first course in SE that focuses on nuts-and-bolts of SE. After learning those fundamentals, in higher level project modules you can focus more on the creative side of software projects
          without being dragged down by nuts-and-bolts SE issues (because you already know how to deal with them). However, we would like to allow some room for creativity too. That is why we let you build products that are slight variations of a given
          theme.</p>
        <p>Also note: The freedom to do 'anything' is not a necessary condition for creativity. Do not mistake being different for being creative. In fact, the more constrained you are, the more you need creativity to stand out.</p>

      <h3 id="why-project-requirements-are-so-vague">Why project requirements are so vague?</h3>
      <div id="handbook-faq-vagueRequirements"><img src="/cs2103-website/handbook/images/vague requirement.png" width="737" height="210">
        <p>&quot;You tell me exactly what to do - I do that - you pay me (in grades)&quot; is a model for contract work, not for learning. Being able to survive in imprecise, uncertain, volatile problem contexts is precisely what we are trying to teach you.</p>
        <p>For example, the best way to communicate something often depends on what is being communicated. That is why we don't specify the precise content for project documents. Instead, we aim to refine project documents iteratively. We believe the learning
          experience will be richer if we let you decide the best way to present your project information rather than just following our instructions blindly. For example, in real-life projects you are rarely told which diagrams to draw; that is a decision
          you have to make yourself.</p>

      <div id="handbook-faq-favoriteTool"><img src="/cs2103-website/handbook/images/I'm not allowed to use my favorite tool.png" width="750" height="287">
        <p>We have chosen a basic set of tools after considering ease of learning, availability, typicalness, popularity, migration path to other tools, etc. There are many reasons for limiting your choices:</p>
        <p>Pedagogical reasons:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>We use 'good enough', not necessarily the best, tools: Most bleeding edge, most specialized, or most sophisticated tools are not suitable for a beginner course. After mastering our toolset, you will find it easy to upgrade to such high-end tools
            by yourself. We do expect you to eventually (after this module) migrate to better tools and, having learned more than one tool, to attain a more general understanding about a family of tools.</li>
          <li>Learn to thrive under given conditions: As a professional Software Engineer, you must learn to be productive in any given tool environment, rather than insist on using your preferred tools. It is usually in small companies doing less important
            work that you get to chose your own toolset. Bigger companies working on mature products often impose some choices on developers, such as the project management tool, code repository, IDE, language etc. For example, Google uses SVN as their
            revision control software. Sometimes this is due to cost reasons (tool licensing cost), and sometimes due to legacy reasons (because the tool is already entrenched in their code base).<br> While programming in school is often a solo sport,
            programming in the industry is a team sport. As we are training you to become professional software engineers, it is important to get over the psychological hurdle of needing to satisfy individual preferences and get used to making the best
            of a given environment.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Practical reasons:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Some of the learning activities are tightly coupled to tools. Allowing more tools means tutors need to learn more tools, which increases their workload.</li>
          <li>We provide learning resources for tools. e.g. 'Getting started with Eclipse'. Allowing more tools means we need to produce more resources.</li>
          <li>When all students use the same tool, the collective expertise of the tool is more, increasing the opportunities for you to learn from each others.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Meanwhile, feel free to share with peers your experience of using other tools.</p>

      <div id="handbook-faq-manySubmissions"><img src="/cs2103-website/handbook/images/frequent submissions.png" width="759" height="359">
        <p>The high number of submissions is not meant to increase workload but to spread it across the semester. Learning theory and applying them should be done in parallel to maximize the learning effect. That can happen only if we spread theory and 'application
          of theory' (i.e., project work) evenly across the semester.</p>

        <p>Intermediate submissions are also incremental submissions. Intermediate submissions are included in the final submission too and will earn marks at that point. They are there to help you do well in the final submission and for us to monitor your
          progress and guide you accordingly. They are a means to an end. They are not achievements themselves. By right, they shouldn't be given marks at all. 😃</p>

        <p>They do, and they should.</p>
        <p>CS2103T communication requirements are limited to a very narrow scope (i.e., communicate about the product to users and developers). CS2101 aims to teach you technical communication in a much wider context. While you may be able to reuse some

      <p>Note: This guide is mostly about getting tech help, but it also applies to getting clarifications on module topics too. e.g. what is the difference between <em>aaa</em> and <em>bbb</em>?</p>
      <p>What not to do: Email lecturer/tutor immediately after you encounter a problem or a doubt, unless it is something only the lecturer/tutor is supposed to know.</p>
      <p>When faced with a technical problem or a doubt about a concept, here are the things you should do:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p><strong>Check what is given</strong>: Check if the problem/concept has been discussed in the lectures, handouts, or the list of resources given to you. Yes it is easier for you to write an email to the tutor/lecturer instead, but that shouldn't
            be your default behavior. We know that sometimes it is difficult to find stuff in handouts/handbook etc. But you should try first.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><strong>Search</strong>: It is very likely the answer already exists somewhere in the cyberspace. Almost every programming-related question has been answered in places like <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/">stackoverflow</a>. Don't give an
            opportunity for someone to tell you, 'Have you heard of a thing called Google?'.<br> Pay attention to the error message you encounter. Sometimes it also contains hints as to how to fix the problem. Even if not, a <mark>web search on the error message</mark>
            is a good starting point.  <br><img src="/cs2103-website/handbook/images/how to google it.png" width="460" height="268"></p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><strong>Ask peers</strong>:</p>
          <p>Ask your team members.</p>
          <p>Ask classmates using the IVLE forum. Asking questions in IVLE is encouraged. Even if you figured out one way to solve a problem, discussing it on IVLE might lead you to better ways of solving it, and will help other classmates who are facing
            similar problems too. If you are really shy to ask questions in IVLE, you may use  <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1vf2TjVhASq_u1_kQEEyURE5fTeBg6iKwGQDJUxYiAmg/viewform">this form</a>  to submit your question anonymously which we
            will then post in the forum.</p>

          <p><strong>Ask the world</strong> using programming forums such as stackoverflow.</p>
          <p>Here are some tips for posting help request:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>PLEASE search for existing answers before you post your question in those public forums; You don't want to appear as a 'clueless' or 'too lazy to do your research' person in a public forum.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Learn to isolate the problem. &quot;My code doesn't work&quot; isn't going to help even if you post the whole code online. Others don't have time to go through all of your code. Isolate the part that doesn't work and strip it down to the
                bare minimum that is enough reproduce the error. Sometimes, this process actually helps you to figure out the problem yourself. If not, at least it increases the chance of someone else being able to help you.<br><span class="bg-info">
Tip: How to isolate problematic code? Delete code (one bit at a time) that is confirmed as not related to the problem. Do that until you can still reproduce the problem with the least amount of code remaining.
</span></p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Generalize the problem. &quot;How to write tasks to a text file using Java&quot; is too specific to what you are working on. You are more likely to find help if you post a thread called (or search for) &quot;How to write to a file using
                Java&quot;.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Explain well. Conversations via online forums take time. If you post everything that is relevant to your problem, you chances of getting an answer in the first try is higher. If others have to ask you more questions before they can help
                you, it will take longer. But this doesn't mean you dump too much information into the thread either.<br><span class="bg-info">Tip: make sure you know what these stand for: RTFM, STFW, GIYF</span></p>

          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div id="project-schedule-tracking">
        <h2 id="project-schedule-tracking">Project Schedule Tracking</h2>
        <p>In general, use the issue tracker (Milestones, Issues, PRs, Tags, Releases, and Labels) for assigning, scheduling, and tracking <em>all</em> noteworthy project tasks, including user stories. Update the issue tracker regularly to reflect the current
          status of the project. You can also use GitHub's new <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6MGKHkNtxU">Projects feature</a> to manage the project, but keep it linked to the issue tracker as much as you can.</p>
        <h3 id="using-issues">Using Issues:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Record each of the user stories you plan to deliver as an issue in the issue tracker.<br> e.g. <code>Title: As a user I can add a deadline</code><br><code>Description: ... so that I can keep track of my deadlines</code></li>
          <li>Assign the <code>type.*</code> and <code>priority.*</code> labels to those issues.</li>
          <li>When you start implementing a story, break it down to tasks. Define reasonable sized, standalone tasks. A task should be able to done by one person, in a few hours. e.g. <br> Good: Update class diagram in the project manual for V0.5<br> Bad (reasons:
            not a one-person task, not small enough): Write the project manual</li>
          <li>Write a descriptive title for the issue. <br> e.g. Add support for the 'undo' command to the parser.</li>
          <li>There is no need to break things into VERY small tasks. Keep them as big as possible, but they should be no bigger than what you are going to assign a single person to do within a week. So the user story <code>Implementing parser</code>  is
            too big because it cannot be done by a single person in a week. However,<code>Implementing parser support for adding of floating tasks</code> is of appropriate size.</li>
          <li>Do not track things taken for granted. e.g., 'push code to repo' should not be a task to track. In the example given under the previous point, it is taken for granted that the owner will also (a) test the code and (b) push to the repo when it
            is ready. Those two need not be tracked as separate tasks.</li>
          <li>Omit unnecessary details. In some cases, the summary/title is enough to describe the task. In that case, no need to repeat it in the description. There is no need for well-crafted and detailed descriptions for tasks. A minimal description is
            enough.<br> Similarly, labels such as 'priority' can be omitted if you think they don't help you.</li>
          <li>Assign tasks to team members using the 'owner' field. At any point, there should be some ongoing tasks and some pending tasks against each team member.</li>
          <li>Use status labels to indicate which tasks are completed, which are ongoing, and which are to be done by next milestone.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3 id="using-milestones">Using Milestones:</h3>
        <p><a name="using-milestones"></a></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Use milestones to indicate which issues are to be handled for which milestone by assigning issues to suitable milestones.</li>
          <li>Set the deadlines for milestones (in GitHub). Your internal milestones can be set earlier than the deadlines we have set, to give you a buffer.</li>
          <li>Note that you can change the milestone plan along the way as necessary.</li>
          <li>IMPORTANT: To consider the milestone as 'reached', <mark>you should have the following done <em>before</em> the tutorial begins. 'Missed milestones' will count against the 'project management' component of your final grade</mark>:
            <ul>
              <li>A working product tagged with the correct tag (e.g. V0.2) and pushed to the main repo.</li>
              <li>All tests passing on Travis.</li>
              <li>Milestone updated to match the product.</li>
              <li>Milestone closed. All issues assigned to that milestone should be closed too.</li>
              <li>Doing a 'release' on GitHub is optional for V0.1 and V0.2 but compulsory from V0.3.</li>

        <p>Here are some examples (ordered in increasing complexity):</p>
        <ul>

  <h1 id="appendix-f-what-to-do-if-there-are-teamwork-issues">Appendix F: What to do if there are teamwork issues</h1>
  <div id="handbook-appendixF-teamworkIssues">
    <div>
      <p>If your team is facing difficulties due to differences in skill/motivation /availability among team members,</p>
      <ul>
        <li>First, <mark>do not expect everyone to have the same skill/motivation level as you</mark>. It is fine if someone wants to do less and have low expectations from the module. That doesn't mean that person is a bad person. Everyone is entitled to
          have their own priorities.</li>
        <li>Second, <mark>don't give up</mark>. It is unfortunate that your team ended up in this situation, but you can turn it into a good learning opportunity. You don't get an opportunity to save a sinking team every day 😃</li>
        <li>Third, if you care about your grade and willing to work for it, you need to take initiative to turn the situation around or else the whole team is going to suffer. Don't hesitate to <mark>take charge</mark> if the situation calls for it. By doing
          so, you'll be doing a favor for your team. Be professional, kind, and courteous to the team members, but also be firm and assertive. It is your grade that is at stake. Don't worry about making a bad situation worse. You won't know until you
          try.</li>
        <li>Finally, don't feed angry or 'wronged'. Teamwork problems are not uncommon in this module and we know how to grade so that you will not be penalized for others' low contribution. We can use Git to find exactly what others did. It's not your responsibility
          to get others to contribute.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Given below are some suggestions you can adopt if the project work is not going smooth due to team issues. Note that the below measures can result in some team members doing more work than others and earning better project grades than others. It
        is still better than sinking the whole team together.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Redistribute the work</strong>: Stronger programmers in the team should take over the critical parts of the code.</li>
        <li><strong>Enforce stricter integration workflow</strong>: Appoint an integrator (typically, the strongest programmer). His/her job is to maintain the integrated version of the code. He/she should not accept any code that breaks the existing product
          or is not up to the acceptable quality standard. It is up to others to submit acceptable code to the integrator. Note that if the integrator rejected your code unreasonably, you can still earn marks for that code. You are allowed to submit such
          'rejected' code for grading. They can earn marks based on the quality of the code. Also refer the workflow described in the 'A safer workflow using forks and pull requests' section of the Handbook: Appendix E (Using GitHub Project Hosting)</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>If you have very unreliable or totally disengaged team members</strong> :</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Re-distribute project work so that such team members cannot bring down the entire team.</li>
        <li>However, do not leave out such team members from project communications. Always keep them in the loop so that they can contribute more any time they wish to.</li>
        <li>Furthermore, evaluate them sincerely and fairly during peer evaluations so that they do get the grade their work deserves, no more, no less.</li>
        <li>Be courteous to such team members too. Some folks have genuine problems that prevent them from contributing more although they may not be able tell you the reasons. Just do your best for the project and assume everyone else is doing their best
          too, although their best may be lower than yours.</li>
