### Session: `Practice Peer Evaluation`

* Objective: to give you a chance to familiarize with the TEAMMATES tool, to see in advance the type feedback that you will give/receive later in the semester.
* Held early in the semester.
* Submission is compulsory. However, ==ratings/responses you receive will not be considered for grading== as this session is for practice only.
* Although this is for practice, we recommend that you give sincere/accurate feedback to others as much as possible so as not to waste this round of peer evaluations.
