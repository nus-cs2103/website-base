    <div>
      <p>In general, each team is expected to take one of these two directions:</p>
      <p><strong>[Direction 1]  <em>Optimize</em></strong> AddressBook for a more specific target user group:</p>
      <panel header="Examples for the _optimize_ direction" expanded="">
        <p>An AddressBook,</p>
        <ul>
          <li>for users in a specific profession <span class="dimmed"> e.g. doctors, salesmen, teachers, etc.</span></li>
          <li>based on the nature/scale of contacts <span class="dimmed"> e.g. huge number of contacts (for HR admins, user group admins), mostly incomplete contacts, highly volatile contact details, contacts become inactive after a specific period (e.g. contract employees)</span></li>
          <li>based on what users do with the contacts <span class="dimmed"> e.g. organize group events, share info, do business, do analytics</span></li>
        </ul>
        <p></p>
      </panel>
      <p></p>
      <p><strong>[Direction 2] <em>Morph</em></strong> AddressBook into a different product: Given that AddressBook is a generic app that manages a type of elements (i.e. contacts), you can use it as a starting point to create an app that manages something
        else.<br> ❗️ This is a high-risk high-reward option because morphing requires extra work but a morphed product may earn more marks than an optimized product of similar complexity.</p>
      <panel header="Examples for _morph_ direction" expanded="">
        <p>An app to manage,</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Bookmarks of websites</li>
          <li>Tasks/Schedule</li>
          <li>Location info</li>
          <li>Thing to memorize i.e. flash cards, trivia</li>
          <li>Forum posts, news feeds, Social media feeds</li>
          <li>Online projects or issue trackers that the user is interested in</li>
          <li>Emails, possibly from different accounts</li>
          <li>Multiple types of related things <span class="dimmed"> e.g. Contacts and Tasks (if Tasks are allocated to Contacts)</span></li>
        </ul>
        <p></p>
      </panel>
      <p></p>
      <p>For either direction, you need to define a target user profile and a value proposition:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p><strong>Target user profile</strong>: Define a very specific target user profile. <br> 💡 We required you narrow down the target user profile <span class="dimmed"> as opposed to trying to make it as general as possible. Here is an example direction of narrowing down target user: anybody → teachers → university teachers → tech savvy university teachers → CS2103 instructors.</span><br>            ❗️ Be careful not to contradict given project constraints when defining the user profile <span class="dimmed"> e.g. the target user should still prefer typing over mouse actions</span>.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><strong>Value proposition</strong>: Define a clear <em>value proposition</em> <span class="dimmed"> what problem does the product solve? how does it make the the user's life easier</span> that matches the target user profile.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>It is expected that your product will be optimized for those specific target users</strong> <span class="dimmed"> i.e., add features that are especially/only applicable for target users (to make the app especially attractive to them). To add to the example above, there can be features that are applicable to CS2103 instructors only, such as the ability to navigate to a student's project on GitHub</span><br>        💡 Your project will be graded based on how well the features match the target user profile and how well the features fit-together.</p>
      <panel header="%%Why the need to narrow down the user profile?%%">
        <ul>
          <li>It is an opportunity to exercise your product design skills because optimizing the product to a very specific target user requires good product design skills.</li>
          <li>It minimizes the overlap between features of different teams which can cause plagiarism issues. Furthermore, higher the number of other teams having the same features, less impressive your work becomes especially if others have done a better
            job of implementing that feature.</li>

      <p>Given their lightweight nature, <strong>user stories are quite handy for recording requirements during early requirements gathering</strong>.</p>
      <tip-box>
        <p>💡 Here are some tips for using user stories for early stages of requirement gathering:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Define the <em>target user</em>:</strong><br> Decide your target user's profile (e.g. a student, office worker, programmer, sales person) and work patterns (e.g. Does he work in groups or alone? Does he share his computer with others?).
            A clear understanding of the target user will help when deciding the importance of a user story. You can even give this user a name. <span class="dimmed"> e.g. Target user Jean is a university student studying in a non-IT field. She interacts with a lot of people due to her involvement in university clubs/societies. ...</span></li>
          <li><strong>Define the <em>problem scope</em>:</strong> Decide that exact problem you are going to solve for the target user. <span class="dimmed"> e.g. Help Jean keep track of all her school contacts</span></li>
          <li><strong>Don't be too hasty to discard 'unusual' user stories:</strong><br> Those might make your product unique and stand out from the rest, at least for the target users.</li>
          <li><strong>Don't go into too much details:</strong><br> For example, consider this user story: <code>As a user, I want to see a list of tasks that needs my attention most at the present time, so that I pay attention to them first.</code><br> When
            discussing this user story, don't worry about what tasks should be considered <em>needs my attention most at the present time</em>. Those details can be worked out later.</li>
          <li><strong>Don't be biased by preconceived product ideas:</strong><br> When you are at the stage of identifying user needs, clear your mind of ideas you have about what your end product will look like.</li>
          <li><strong>Don't discuss implementation details or whether you are actually going to implement it:</strong><br> When gathering requirements, your decision is whether the user's need is important enough for you to want to fulfil it. Implementation
            details can be discussed later. If a user story turns out to be too difficult to implement later, you can always omit it from the implementation plan.</li>
        </ul>
      </tip-box>
    </div>
  </modal>
  <panel header="%%:package: User Story examples (from a different product)%%">
    <p><code>As a user I can add a task by specifying a task description only, so that I can record tasks that need to be done ‘some day’.</code><br>
      <code>As a user I can find upcoming tasks, so that I can decide what needs to be done soon.</code><br>
      <code>As a user I can delete a task, so that I can get rid of tasks that I no longer care to track.</code><br>
      <code>As a new user I can view more information about a particular command, so that I can learn how to use various commands.</code><br>
      <code>As an advanced user I can use shorter versions of a command, so that type a command faster.</code></p>

  <h4 id="step-3-prioritize-the-user-stories">Step 3: Prioritize the user stories</h4>
  <img src="/website-base/admin/images/userstories.png" width="250px">
  <p>Suggested workflow:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>Take one user story at a time and get team member opinions about it.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Based on the team consensus, put the story (i.e. the piece of paper) onto one of these three piles:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><code>Must-Have</code> : The product will be practically useless to the target user without this feature.</li>
        <li><code>Nice-To-Have</code> : The target user can benefit from this user story significantly but you are not certain if you'll have time to implement it.</li>
        <li><code>Not-Useful</code> : No significant benefit to the target user, or does not fit into the product vision.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><span class="dimmed">If using physical paper to record user stories: After all stories have been put in the above three piles, you can make a record of which stories are in the three piles.</span></p>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <h4 id="step-4-record-v20-requirements-in-the-developer-guide">Step 4: Record v2.0 Requirements in the Developer Guide</h4>
  <p>Based on your user story categorization in step 1, given project requirements, and the current state of the product, select which user stories you are likely to include in v2.0.</p>
  <p>Update the following pages of the Developer Guide:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Target user profile</strong>, <strong>value proposition</strong>, and
      <trigger trigger="click" for="modal:v10-userstories"><strong>user stories</strong></trigger>: Update the target user profile and value proposition to match the project direction you have selected. Give a list of the user stories (and update/delete existing ones, if applicable), including priorities.
      This can include user stories considered but will not be included in the final product.</li>
    <li>
      <trigger trigger="click" for="modal:v10-usecases"><strong>Use cases</strong></trigger>: Give use cases (textual form) for a few representative user stories that need multiple steps to complete. <span class="dimmed">e.g. Adding a tag to a person (assume the user needs to find the person first)</span></li>
    <li>
      <trigger trigger="click" for="modal:v10-nfr"><strong>Non-functional requirements</strong></trigger>:<br> Note: Many of the project constraints mentioned above are NFRs. You can add more. e.g. performance requirements, usability requirements, scalability requirements, etc.</li>
    <li>

    <li>[Optional]
      <trigger trigger="click" for="modal:v10-prodsurveys"><strong>Product survey</strong></trigger>: Explore a few similar/related products and describe your findings i.e. Pros, cons, (from the target user's point of view).</li>

                        <p>Consider a simple movie ticket vending machine application. Every week, the theatre staff will enter the weekly schedule as well as ticket price for each show. A customer sees the schedule and the ticket price displayed at the
                          machine. There is a slot to insert money, a keypad to enter a code for a movie, a code for the show time, and the number of tickets. A display shows the customer's balance inside the machine. A customer may choose to cancel a
                          transaction before pressing the “buy” button. Printed tickets can be collected from a slot at the bottom of the machine. The machine also displays messages such as &quot;Please enter more money”, “Request fewer tickets&quot;
                          or &quot;SOLD OUT!”. Finally, a &quot;Return Change&quot; button allows the customer to get back his unspent money.</p>

                        <p>The system is to be used by Testers, Programmers and System Administrators. Only an administrator can create new users and assign tasks to programmers. Any tester can create a bug report, as well as set the status of a bug report
                          as ‘closed’. Only a programmer can set the state of a bug report to ‘fixed’, but a programmer cannot set the status of a bug report to ‘closed’. Each tester is assigned just one task at a time. A task involves testing of a particular
                          component for a particular customer. Tester must document the bugs they find. Each bug is given a unique identifier. Other information recorded about the bug is component id, severity, date and time reported, programmer who is
                          assigned to fix it, date fixed, date retested and date closed. The system keeps track of which bugs are assigned to which programmer at any given time. It should be able to generate reports on the number of bugs found, fixed
                          and closed e.g. number of bugs per component and per customer; number of bugs found by a particular tester ; number of bugs awaiting to be fixed; number of bugs awaiting to be retested; number of bugs awaiting to be assigned

                          <p><strong>Explanation</strong>: The given description contains information not relevant to use case modeling. Furthermore, the description is not enough to complete the use case diagram All these are realities of real projects.
                            However, the process of trying to create this use case diagram prompts us to investigate issues such as:</p>
                          <ul>
                            <li>Is ‘edit bug report’ a use case or editing the bug report is covered by other use cases such as those for setting the status of bug reports? If it is indeed a separate use case, who are the actors of that use case?</li>
                            <li>Does ‘assign task’ simply means ‘assign bug report’ or is there any other type of tasks?</li>
                            <li>There was some mention about Customers and Components. Does the system have to support use cases for creating and maintaining details about those entities? For example, should we have a ‘create customer record’ use case?</li>
                            <li>Which actors can perform the ‘generate report’ use case? Are reports generated automatically by the system at a specific time or generated ‘on demand’ when users request to view them? Do we have to treat different types of
                              reports as different use cases (in case some types of reports are restricted to some types of users)? The above diagram assumes (just for illustration) that the report is generated on demand and only the system admin can
                              generate any report.</li>

              <p><strong>You can use actor generalization in use case diagrams</strong> using a symbol similar to that of UML notation for inheritance.</p>
              <tip-box>
                <p>📦 In this example, actor <code>Blogger</code> can do all the use cases the actor <code>Guest</code> can do, as a result of the actor generalization relationship given in the diagram.</p>
                <img src="/website-base/book/specifyingRequirements/useCases/usage/images/actorGeneralisation.png" height="250"></tip-box>
              <p>💡 Do not over-complicate use case diagrams by trying to include everything possible. A use case diagram is a brief summary of the use cases that is used as a starting point. Details of the use cases can be given in the use case descriptions.</p>
              <p><strong>Some include ‘System’ as an actor to indicate that something is done by the system itself without being initiated by a user or an external system.</strong></p>
              <tip-box>
                <p>📦 The diagram below can be used to indicate that the system generates daily reports at midnight.</p>
                <img src="/website-base/book/specifyingRequirements/useCases/usage/images/systemAsActor.jpg" height="200"></tip-box>
              <p>However, others argue that only use cases providing value to an external user/system should be shown in the use case diagram. For example, they argue that ‘view daily report’ should be the use case and <code>generate daily report</code>                is not to be shown in the use case diagram because it is simply something the system has to do to support the <code>view daily report</code> use case.</p>
              <p>We recommend that you follow the latter view (i.e. not to use System as a user). Limit use cases for modeling behaviors that involve an external actor.</p>
              <p><strong>UML is not very specific about the text contents of a use case.</strong> Hence, there are many styles for writing use cases. For example, the steps can be written as a continuous paragraph. Use cases should be easy to read. Note
                that there is no strict rule about writing all details of all steps or a need to use all the elements of a use case.</p>
              <p><strong>There are some advantages of documenting system requirements as use cases:</strong></p>
              <ul>
                <li>Because they use a simple notation and plain English descriptions, they are easy for users to understand and give feedback.</li>
                <li>They decouple user intention from mechanism (note that use cases should not include UI-specific details), allowing the system designers more freedom to optimize how a functionality is provided to a user.</li>
                <li>Identifying all possible extensions encourages us to consider all situations that a software product might face during its operation.</li>
                <li>Separating typical scenarios from special cases encourages us to optimize the typical scenarios.</li>
              </ul>
              <p><strong>One of the main disadvantages of use cases is that they are not good for capturing requirements that does not involve a user interacting with the system.</strong> Hence, they should not be used as the sole means to specify requirements.</p>

            <p>To illustrate how the workflow goes, let’s assume Jean wants to fix a bug in the code. Here are the steps:</p>

              <li>Other members review Jean’s pull request.</li>
              <li>If reviewers suggested any changes, Jean updates the PR accordingly.</li>
              <li>When reviewers are satisfied with the PR, one of the members (usually the team lead or a designated 'maintainer' of the main repo) merges the PR, which brings Jean’s code to the main repo.</li>
              <li>Other members, realizing there is new code in the upstream repo, sync their forks with the new upstream repo (i.e. the main repo). This is done by pulling the new code to their own local repo and pushing the updated code to their own fork.</li>

          <ol>
            <li>Download <code>Collate-TUI.jar</code> from the <a href="https://github.com/se-edu/collate">Collate Tool project</a></li>
            <li>Annotate your code to indicate who wrote which part of the code (instructions given below)</li>
            <li>Run the Collate tool to collate code written by each person into separate files (instructions given below)</li>
          </ol>
          <h4 id="annotating-code-to-indicate-authorship">Annotating code to indicate authorship</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>Mark your code with a <code>//@@author {yourGithubUsername}</code>. Note the double <code>@</code>.<br> The <code>//@@author</code> tag should appear only at the beginning of the code you wrote. The code up to the next <code>//@@author</code>                tag or the end of the file (whichever comes first) will be considered as was written by that author. Here is a sample code file:</p>
              <pre class="hljs"><code>//@@author johndoe
method 1 ...
method 2 ...
//@@author sarahkhoo
method 3 ...
//@@author johndoe
method 4 ...
</code></pre>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p><strong>If you don't know who wrote the code segment below yours</strong>, you may put an empty <code>//@@author</code> (i.e. no GitHub username) to indicate the end of the code segment you wrote. The author of code below yours can add the
                GitHub username to the empty tag later. Here is a sample code with an empty <code>author</code> tag:</p>
              <pre class="hljs"><code>method 0 ...
//@@author johndoe
method 1 ...
method 2 ...
//@@author
method 3 ...
method 4 ...
</code></pre>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p><strong>The author tag syntax varies based on file type</strong> e.g. for java, css, fxml. Use the corresponding comment syntax for non-Java files.<br> Here is an example code from an xml file.</p>
              <pre class="hljs"><code>&lt;!-- @@author sereneWong --&gt;
&lt;textbox&gt;
  &lt;label&gt;...&lt;/label&gt;
  &lt;input&gt;...&lt;/input&gt;
&lt;/textbox&gt;
...
</code></pre>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p><strong>Do not put the <code>//@@author</code> inside java header comments</strong> as only the content below that tag will be collated.<br> 👎⤵️
              </p>
              <pre class="hljs"><code>/**
  * Returns true if ...
  * @@author johndoe
  */
</code></pre>
              <p>👍⤵️</p>
              <pre class="hljs"><code>//@@author johndoe
/**
  * Returns true if ...
  */
</code></pre>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <h4 id="what-to-and-what-not-to-annotate">What to and what not to annotate</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p><strong>Annotate both functional and test code but not documentation files.</strong></p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p><strong>Annotate only significant size code blocks that can be reviewed on its own</strong> <span class="dimmed"> e.g., a class, a sequence of methods, a  method.</span> <br> <strong>Claiming credit for code blocks smaller than a method is discouraged</strong>                but allowed. If you do, do it sparingly and only claim meaningful blocks of code such as a block of statements, a loop, or an if-else statement%%.</p>
              <ul>
                <li>If an enhancement required you to do tiny changes in many places, there is no need to collate all those tiny changes; you can describe those changes in the Project Portfolio page instead.</li>
                <li>If a code block was touched by more than one person, either let the person who wrote most of it (e.g. more than 80%) take credit for the entire block, or leave it as 'unclaimed' (i.e., no author tags).</li>
                <li>Related to the above point, <mark>if you claim a code block as your own, more than 80% of the code in that block should have been written by yourself</mark>. For example, no more than 20% of it can be code you reused from somewhere.</li>
                <li>💡 GitHub has a <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/tracing-changes-in-a-file/"><em>blame</em> feature and a <em>history</em></a> feature that can help you determine who wrote a piece of code.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p><strong>Do not try to boost the length of your collated files using dubious means</strong> such as duplicating the same code in multiple places. In particular, do not copy-paste test cases to create redundant tests. Even repetitive code
                blocks within test methods should be extracted out as utility methods to reduce code duplication.<br> Individual members are responsible for making sure their own collated files contain the correct content.<br> If you notice a team member
                claiming credit for code that he/she did not write or use other questionable tactics, you can email us (after the final submission) to let us know.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p><strong>If you wrote a significant amount of code that was not used in the final product</strong>,</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Create a folder called <code>{project root}/unused</code></li>
                <li>Move unused files (or copies of files containing unused code) to that folder</li>
                <li>use <code>//@@author {yourGithubUsername}-unused</code> to mark unused code in those files (note the suffix <code>unused</code>) e.g.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <pre class="hljs"><code>//@@author johndoe-unused
method 1 ...
method 2 ...
</code></pre>
              <p>Please put a comment in the code to explain why it was not used.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p><strong>If you reused code from elsewhere,</strong> mark such code as <code>//@@author {yourGithubUsername}-reused</code> (note the suffix <code>reused</code>) e.g.
              </p>
              <pre class="hljs"><code>//@@author johndoe-reused
method 1 ...
method 2 ...
</code></pre>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p><strong>For code generated by the IDE/framework,</strong> should not be annotated as your own.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p><strong>Code you modified in minor ways</strong> e.g. adding a parameter. These can be left out of collated code but can be mentioned in the Project Portfolio page if you want to claim credit for them.</p>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <h4 id="collating-the-annotated-code">Collating the annotated code</h4>
          <p>You need to put the collated code in the following folders</p>
          <table class="markbind-table table table-bordered table-striped">

          <p>Refer to <a href="https://github.com/se-edu/collate/blob/master/docs/User-Guide.md">Collate Tool's user guide</a> to find how to run the tool over the annotated code.</p>
          <p>Given below are DOS sample commands you can put in a batch file and run it to collate the code.</p>
          <pre class="hljs"><code>java -jar Collate-TUI.jar collate from src/main to collated/functional include java, fxml, css

                  The actual amount of content you require is actually less than what these numbers suggest because the HTML → PDF conversion adds a lot of spacing around content.
