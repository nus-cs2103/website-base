The tP spans ten weeks, and is to be done in _breadth-first iterative_ fashion.

****The first portion of the tP**** **will be spent of laying out the foundation for the iterations**, as illustrated below. This portion of the tP is light because you will be doing the individual project (iP) in parallel during this time.

{{ project_gantt_pre(g) }}
--Note: that the diagrams above show the relative size of tasks i.e., smaller tasks are shown as shorter bars--

{% set tfw = (tp_first_week | int) %}

<div class="indented-level2">

#### {{ badge("Week " + tfw)}} {{ weekly_tp_themes.w3.name }}

* Form teams.{{ bullet_target_green }}
* Set weekly meeting times.

#### {{ badge("Week " + (tfw + 1))}} {{ weekly_tp_themes.w4.name }}

* Decide on a general direction for the project %%(i.e., target user profile, and problem addressed)%%.{{ bullet_target_green }}

#### {{ badge("Week " + (tfw + 2))}} {{ weekly_tp_themes.w5.name }}

* Gather requirements in the form of _user stories_.{{ bullet_target_green }}
* Decide which of them will go into the first version.

#### {{ badge("Week " + (tfw + 3))}} {{ weekly_tp_themes.w6.name }}

* Decide how the MVP version of the product will look like (i.e., {{ version_mvp }}).{{ bullet_target_green }}{% if cs2113 %}
* Record that product concept in the form of a user guide.
* Set up the development environment.{% endif %}

</div>


****The second portion of the tP**** **is divided into multiple iterations**, each of which is expected to produce a working version of the product by evolving the product delivered in the previous iteration.

<div tags="m--cs2113" class="indented-level2">

#### {{ badge("Week " + (tfw + 4))}} {{ weekly_tp_themes.w7.name }}

#### {{ badge("&nbsp;W" + (tfw + 5)+ "&nbsp;")}} {{ badge("&nbsp;W" + (tfw + 6)+ "&nbsp;")}} Iteration 1 → {{ version_mvp }}

* This is the first proper iteration.{{ bullet_target_green }}

**Aim to do 'just enough':**{.text-info}
Note how the <span class="text-success">:fas-crosshairs: **Product goal**</span> (together with the <span class="text-success">:fas-crosshairs: **Strategy**</span>) is simply a means to achieve the <span class="text-success">:fas-crosshairs: **Learning outcome**</span>. Unlike in a real SE project, the product in the tP exists only to help you achieve the learning outcome. Hence, aim to **do 'just enough' work on the product to achieve the intended learning outcome of the iteration** %%(e.g., don't make features bigger than necessary)%% so that the tP doesn't add to your workload more than necessary.
