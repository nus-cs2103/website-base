<div id="policy-followingInstructions">
  <p>When working with others, especially in a large class such as CS2103,  it is very important that you adhere to standards, policies, and instructions imposed on everyone. Not doing so creates unnecessary headaches for everyone and sends negative signals
    about your work attitude. That is why we penalize for not following instructions carefully.</p>

    the prof did not notice your post or the email got stuck somewhere.</p>
  <p>Similarly we expect you to check email regularly and respond to emails written to you personally (not mass email) promptly.</p>
  <panel header="Email etiquette: ALWAYS respond to direct emails" expanded="">
    <p>Not responding to a personal email is a major breach of professional etiquette (and general civility). Imagine how pissed off you would be if you met the prof along the corridor, said 'Hi prof, good morning' and the prof walked away without saying
      anything back. Not responding to a personal email is just as bad. Always take a few seconds to at least acknowledge such emails.  It doesn't take long to type &quot;Noted. Thanks&quot; and hit 'send'.</p>
    <p>The promptness of a reply is even more important when the email is requesting you for something that you cannot provide. Imagine you wrote to the prof requesting a reference letter and the prof did not respond at all because he/she did not want to
      give you one; You'll be quite frustrated because you wouldn't know whether to look for another prof or wait longer for a response. Saying 'No' is fine and in fact a necessary part of professional life; but saying nothing is not acceptable. If you
      didn't reply, the sender will not even know whether you received the email.</p>

      <p>In this module, we want to move you away from 'hand holding'. We want you to learn how to solve problems on your own. This is a vital survival skill in the industry and it needs practice.</p>
      <p>Whether it is a technical problem (e.g. error when using the IDE) or a doubt about a concept (e.g. what is the difference between scripted testing and exploratory testing?) the teaching team is happy to work with you when you look for a solution/answer.
        But we do not do it for you. Do not fire off an ‘SOS’ email to the lecturer/tutor right away. We discourage unconditional direct help because we want you to learn to help yourself. Yes, we believe in ‘tough love’.</p>
      <p>The question you should always ask yourself is, 'how do I solve this problem if the lecturer/tutors are not around to help me?'</p><img src="/website/admin/images/the good reasons to get home early.png" width="300">
      <p>Note: This guide is mostly about getting tech help, but it also applies to getting clarifications on module topics too. e.g. what is the difference between <em>refactoring</em> and <em>rewriting</em>?</p>
      <p>What not to do: Email lecturer/tutor immediately after you encounter a problem or a doubt, unless it is something only the lecturer/tutor is supposed to know.</p>
      <p>When faced with a technical problem or a doubt about a concept, here are the things you should do:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p><strong>Check what is given</strong>: Check if the problem/concept has been discussed in the lectures, text book, or the list of resources given to you. Yes it is easier for you to write an email to the tutor/lecturer instead, but that shouldn't
            be your default behavior. We know that sometimes it is difficult to find stuff in the resources we have provided. But you should try first.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><strong>Search</strong>: It is very likely the answer already exists somewhere in the cyberspace. Almost every programming-related question has been answered in places like <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/">stackoverflow</a>. Don't give an
            opportunity for someone to ask you to <a href="http://www.jibble.org/stfw/">STFW</a>.<br> Pay attention to the error message you encounter. Sometimes it also contains hints as to how to fix the problem. Even if not, a <mark>web search on the error message</mark>
            is a good starting point.  <br><img src="/website/admin/images/how to google it.png" width="460" height="268"></p>

          <p><strong>Ask peers</strong>:</p>
          <p>Ask your team members.</p>
          <p>Ask classmates using the IVLE forum. Asking questions in IVLE is encouraged. Even if you figured out one way to solve a problem, discussing it on IVLE might lead you to better ways of solving it, and will help other classmates who are facing
            similar problems too. If you are really shy to ask questions in IVLE, you may use  <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1vf2TjVhASq_u1_kQEEyURE5fTeBg6iKwGQDJUxYiAmg/viewform">this form</a>  to submit your question anonymously which we

            <p><em>Rubber duck debugging</em> is an informal term used in software engineering to refer to a method of debugging code. The name is a reference to a story in the book The Pragmatic Programmer in which a programmer would carry around a rubber
              duck and debug his code by forcing himself to explain it, line-by-line, to the duck.</p>

          <p><strong>Ask the world</strong> using programming forums such as stackoverflow.</p>
          <p>Here are some tips for posting help request:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>PLEASE search for existing answers before you post your question in those public forums; You don't want to appear as a 'clueless' or 'too lazy to do your research' person in a public forum.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Learn to isolate the problem. &quot;My code doesn't work&quot; isn't going to help even if you post the whole code online. Others don't have time to go through all of your code. Isolate the part that doesn't work and strip it down to the
                bare minimum that is enough reproduce the error. Sometimes, this process actually helps you to figure out the problem yourself. If not, at least it increases the chance of someone else being able to help you.<br>
                <tip-box type="tip">
                  How to isolate problematic code? Delete code (one bit at a time) that is confirmed as not related to the problem. Do that until you can still reproduce the problem with the least amount of code remaining.
                </tip-box>
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Generalize the problem. &quot;How to write tasks to a text file using Java&quot; is too specific to what you are working on. You are more likely to find help if you post a thread called (or search for) &quot;How to write to a file using
                Java&quot;.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Explain well. Conversations via online forums take time. If you post everything that is relevant to your problem, your chances of getting an answer in the first try is higher. If others have to ask you more questions before they can help
                you, it will take longer. But this doesn't mean you dump too much information into the thread either.<br>

  <p>The source code are publicly available and are available for reuse by others without any restrictions. <br> Is publishing submissions unfair to the team? We don't think so. If you were the first to think of something your peers are willing to adopt

<h3 id="policy-on-plagiarism">Policy on plagiarism</h3>
<div id="policy-plagiarism">
  <p>We encourage sharing, but you should share with everyone in the class, not just a selected group. That is,</p>

  <p>If you submit code (or adopt ideas) taken from elsewhere, you need to comply with our reuse policy.</p>
  <p>Detection:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Detecting plagiarism in code is quite easy. You are not fooling anyone by reordering code or renaming methods/variables.</li>
    <li>As ll your submissions are published to the class, sooner or later somebody will notice the plagiarism.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Penalties:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>For activities earning participation marks: We make a record of cases of plagiarism but we do not take further action. Because participation marks are given for effort and all students can earn the full marks easily, such plagiarism does not disadvantage
      other students. Therefore, we prefer to spend all available resources on helping honest students to do better rather than to chase after dishonest students. If you think you gain something by plagiarizing, go ahead and do it. It's your choice and
      it's your loss.</li>
