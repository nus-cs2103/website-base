<div id="policy-followingInstructions">
  <p>When working with others, especially in a large class such as CS2103,  it is very important that you adhere to standards, policies, and instructions imposed on everyone. Not doing so creates unnecessary headaches for everyone and puts your work attitude
    in a negative light. That is why we penalize repeated violations of instructions. On the other hand we do understand that humans are liable to make mistakes. That is why we only penalize repeated or frequent mistakes.</p>

    <p>Not responding to a personal email is a major breach of professional etiquette (and general civility). Imagine how pissed off you would be if you met the prof along the corridor, said 'Hi prof, good morning' and the prof walked away without saying
      anything back. Not responding to a personal email is just as bad. Always take a few seconds to at least acknowledge such emails.  It doesn't take long to type &quot;Noted. Thanks&quot; and hit 'send'.</p>
    <p>The promptness of a reply is even more important when the email is requesting you for something that you cannot provide. Imagine you wrote to the prof requesting a reference letter and the prof did not respond at all because he/she did not want to
      give you one; You'll be quite frustrated because you wouldn't know whether to look for another prof or wait longer for a response. Saying 'No' is fine and in fact a necessary part of professional life; but saying nothing is not acceptable. If you
      didn't reply, the sender will not even know whether you received the email.</p>

      <p>The question you should always ask yourself is, 'how do I solve this problem if the lecturer/tutors are not around to help me?'</p>

      <p>Note: This guide is mostly about getting tech help, but it also applies to getting clarifications on module topics too. e.g. what is the difference between <em>refactoring</em> and <em>rewriting</em>?</p>
      <p>What not to do:</p>
      <p>When faced with a technical problem or a doubt about a concept, don'f fire off an email lecturer/tutor immediately after you encounter a problem or a doubt, unless it is something only the lecturer/tutor is supposed to know. Instead, here are some
        things you can do:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p><strong>Check what is given</strong>: Check if the problem/concept has been discussed in the lectures, text book, or the list of resources given to you. Yes it is easier for you to write an email to the tutor/lecturer instead, but that shouldn't
            be your default behavior. We know that sometimes it is difficult to find stuff in the resources we have provided. But you should try first.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><strong>Search</strong>: It is very likely the answer already exists somewhere in the cyberspace. Almost every programming-related question has been answered in places like <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/">stackoverflow</a>. Don't give an
            opportunity for someone to ask you to <a href="http://www.jibble.org/stfw/">STFW</a>.<br> Pay attention to the error message you encounter. Sometimes it also contains hints as to how to fix the problem. Even if not, a web search on the error
            message is a good starting point.  <br>
            <img src="/website-base/admin/images/how to google it.png" width="460" height="268"></p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><strong>Ask peers</strong>:</p>
          <p>Ask your team members.</p>
          <p>Ask classmates using the module forum or the slack channel. Even if you figured out one way to solve a problem, discussing it on a public forum might lead you to better ways of solving it, and will help other classmates who are facing similar
            problems too. If you are really shy to ask questions in the forum, you may use <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1vf2TjVhASq_u1_kQEEyURE5fTeBg6iKwGQDJUxYiAmg/viewform">this form</a> to submit your question anonymously which we will

            <p><em>Rubber duck debugging</em> is an informal term used in software engineering to refer to a method of debugging code. The name is a reference to a story in the book The Pragmatic Programmer in which a programmer would carry around a rubber

        <li>
          <p><strong>Ask the world</strong> using programming forums such as stackoverflow.</p>
          <p>Here are some tips for posting help request:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>PLEASE search for existing answers before you post your question in those public forums; You don't want to appear as a 'clueless' or 'too lazy to do your research' person in a public forum.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Learn to isolate the problem. &quot;My code doesn't work&quot; isn't going to help even if you post the whole code online. Others don't have time to go through all of your code. Isolate the part that doesn't work and strip it down to the
                bare minimum that is enough reproduce the error. Sometimes, this process actually helps you to figure out the problem yourself. If not, at least it increases the chance of someone else being able to help you.</p>
              <tip-box>
                <p>💡 How to isolate problematic code? Delete code (one bit at a time) that is confirmed as not related to the problem. Do that until you can still reproduce the problem with the least amount of code remaining.</p>
              </tip-box>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Generalize the problem. &quot;How to write tasks to a text file using Java&quot; is too specific to what you are working on. You are more likely to find help if you post a thread called (or search for) &quot;How to write to a file using
                Java&quot;.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Explain well. Conversations via online forums take time. If you post everything that is relevant to your problem, your chances of getting an answer in the first try is higher. If others have to ask you more questions before they can help
                you, it will take longer. But this doesn't mean you dump too much information into the thread either.</p>

      <p>Collate is a tool for collating code written by different developers.</p>
      <p>Steps to use Collate:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Download <code>Collate-TUI.jar</code> from the <a href="https://github.com/se-edu/collate">Collate Tool project</a></li>
        <li>Annotate your code to indicate who wrote which part of the code (instructions given below)</li>
        <li>Run the Collate tool to collate code written by each person into separate files (instructions given below)</li>
      </ol>
      <h4 id="annotating-code-to-indicate-authorship">Annotating code to indicate authorship</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>Mark your code with a <code>//@@author {yourGithubUsername}</code>. Note the double <code>@</code>.<br> The <code>//@@author</code> tag should appear only at the beginning of the code you wrote. The code up to the next <code>//@@author</code>            tag or the end of the file (whichever comes first) will be considered as was written by that author. Here is a sample code file:</p>
          <pre class="hljs"><code>//@@author johndoe
method 1 ...
method 2 ...
//@@author sarahkhoo
method 3 ...
//@@author johndoe
method 4 ...
</code></pre>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><strong>If you don't know who wrote the code segment below yours</strong>, you may put an empty <code>//@@author</code> (i.e. no GitHub username) to indicate the end of the code segment you wrote. The author of code below yours can add the GitHub
            username to the empty tag later. Here is a sample code with an empty <code>author</code> tag:</p>
          <pre class="hljs"><code>method 0 ...
//@@author johndoe
method 1 ...
method 2 ...
//@@author
method 3 ...
method 4 ...
</code></pre>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><strong>The author tag syntax varies based on file type</strong> e.g. for java, css, fxml. Use the corresponding comment syntax for non-Java files.<br> Here is an example code from an xml file.</p>
          <pre class="hljs"><code>&lt;!-- @@author sereneWong --&gt;
&lt;textbox&gt;
  &lt;label&gt;...&lt;/label&gt;
  &lt;input&gt;...&lt;/input&gt;
&lt;/textbox&gt;
...
</code></pre>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><strong>Do not put the <code>//@@author</code> inside java header comments</strong> as only the content below that tag will be collated.<br> 👎⤵️
          </p>
          <pre class="hljs"><code>/**
  * Returns true if ...
  * @@author johndoe
  */
</code></pre>
          <p>👍⤵️</p>
          <pre class="hljs"><code>//@@author johndoe
/**
  * Returns true if ...
  */
</code></pre>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h4 id="what-to-and-what-not-to-annotate">What to and what not to annotate</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p><strong>Annotate both functional and test code but not documentation files.</strong></p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><strong>Annotate only significant size code blocks that can be reviewed on its own</strong> <span class="dimmed"> e.g., a class, a sequence of methods, a  method.</span> <br> <strong>Claiming credit for code blocks smaller than a method is discouraged</strong>            but allowed. If you do, do it sparingly and only claim meaningful blocks of code such as a block of statements, a loop, or an if-else statement%%.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>If an enhancement required you to do tiny changes in many places, there is no need to collate all those tiny changes; you can describe those changes in the Project Portfolio page instead.</li>
            <li>If a code block was touched by more than one person, either let the person who wrote most of it (e.g. more than 80%) take credit for the entire block, or leave it as 'unclaimed' (i.e., no author tags).</li>
            <li>Related to the above point, <mark>if you claim a code block as your own, more than 80% of the code in that block should have been written by yourself</mark>. For example, no more than 20% of it can be code you reused from somewhere.</li>
            <li>💡 GitHub has a <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/tracing-changes-in-a-file/"><em>blame</em> feature and a <em>history</em></a> feature that can help you determine who wrote a piece of code.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><strong>Do not try to boost the length of your collated files using dubious means</strong> such as duplicating the same code in multiple places. In particular, do not copy-paste test cases to create redundant tests. Even repetitive code blocks
            within test methods should be extracted out as utility methods to reduce code duplication.<br> Individual members are responsible for making sure their own collated files contain the correct content.<br> If you notice a team member claiming
            credit for code that he/she did not write or use other questionable tactics, you can email us (after the final submission) to let us know.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><strong>If you wrote a significant amount of code that was not used in the final product</strong>,</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Create a folder called <code>{project root}/unused</code></li>
            <li>Move unused files (or copies of files containing unused code) to that folder</li>
            <li>use <code>//@@author {yourGithubUsername}-unused</code> to mark unused code in those files (note the suffix <code>unused</code>) e.g.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <pre class="hljs"><code>//@@author johndoe-unused
method 1 ...
method 2 ...
</code></pre>
          <p>Please put a comment in the code to explain why it was not used.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><strong>If you reused code from elsewhere,</strong> mark such code as <code>//@@author {yourGithubUsername}-reused</code> (note the suffix <code>reused</code>) e.g.
          </p>
          <pre class="hljs"><code>//@@author johndoe-reused
method 1 ...
method 2 ...
</code></pre>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><strong>For code generated by the IDE/framework,</strong> should not be annotated as your own.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><strong>Code you modified in minor ways</strong> e.g. adding a parameter. These can be left out of collated code but can be mentioned in the Project Portfolio page if you want to claim credit for them.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h4 id="collating-the-annotated-code">Collating the annotated code</h4>
      <p>You need to put the collated code in the following folders</p>
      <table class="markbind-table table table-bordered table-striped">
        <thead>
          <tr>
            <th>Code Type</th>
            <th>Folder</th>
          </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
          <tr>
            <td>functional code</td>
            <td><code>collated/functional</code></td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>test code</td>
            <td><code>collated/test</code></td>

            <td><code>collated/unused</code></td>
          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>
      <p>Refer to <a href="https://github.com/se-edu/collate/blob/master/docs/User-Guide.md">Collate Tool's user guide</a> to find how to run the tool over the annotated code.</p>
      <p>Given below are DOS sample commands you can put in a batch file and run it to collate the code.</p>
      <pre class="hljs"><code>java -jar Collate-TUI.jar collate from src/main to collated/functional include java, fxml, css

java -jar Collate-TUI.jar collate from src/test to collated/test include java

java -jar Collate-TUI.jar collate from unused to collated/unused include java, fxml, css
</code></pre>
      <p>The output should be something like the structure given below.</p>
      <pre class="hljs"><code>collated/
    functional/
        johndoe.md
        sarahkhoo.md

      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>After running the collate tool, you are recommended to look through the generated <strong>.md</strong> files to ensure all your code has been extracted correctly.</p>

                <li>features you implemented <span class="dimmed"> (include relevant extracts from the user guide and the developer guide)</span></li>
                <li>features you propose to implement in future <span class="dimmed"> (include relevant extracts from the user guide and the developer guide if applicable)</span><br> Note: the purpose of allowing you to include <em>proposed</em> features
                  is to provide you more flexibility to show your documentation skills. <span class="dimmed"> e.g. you can bring in a proposed feature just to give you an opportunity to use a UML diagram type not used by the actual features.</span></li>
                <li>other significant contributions to the project <span class="dimmed"> e.g. tweaks to existing features, setting up project tools</span></li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Other things you can include:
              <ul>
                <li>Evidence of helping others <span class="dimmed"> e.g. responses you posted in our forum, bugs you reported in other team's products</span>,</li>
                <li>Evidence of technical leadership <span class="dimmed"> e.g. offering features for others to reuse, evidence of those features being reused by others</span></li>

        <li>
          <p><strong>Format</strong>:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Page limit: If you have more content than the limit given below, shorten (or omit some content) so that you do not exceed the page limit. Having too much content in the PPP will be viewed unfavorably during grading. Note: the <mark>page limits given below are <em>after</em> converting to PDF format</mark>.
              The actual amount of content you require is actually less than what these numbers suggest because the HTML → PDF conversion adds a lot of spacing around content.
