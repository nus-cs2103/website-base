Tip for future reference: GitHub allows you to filter PRs/Issues using various criteria such as `author:AuthorUsername` ([example](https://github.com/reposense/RepoSense/pulls?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Apr+author%3Afzdy1914+) -- see the `filters` text box in the target page).

Alternatively, you can use PR labels (if any) to filter PRs/Issues.<br>

:fas-question-circle: FAQ: How many comments should I add? Answer: Depends on the code being reviewed but we expect most PRs would warrant at least 4-5 comments. If the PR is huge, you can stop when you think you've put in a fair amount of time on the job (~15 minutes) and added enough comments for the PR author to receive some value.

**Suggested pre-tutorial preparations**:
* Clone the [{{ url_module_org }}/personbook]({{ url_module_org }}/personbook) repo to your Computer (no need to fork first).
* Set it up in your IDE.
* Use the IDE debugging to step through the code to understand how the code works. For example, you can try to find answers to these questions:
  * How to add a new `find` command to locate persons by name?
  * What's the purpose of the variable `PersonBook#lastShownList`? Is it really needed?

<div class="indented">

During the tutorial, **demo your ability to do debugging using an IDE** by performing the following tasks:

1. Set a breakpoint in the following method of the `Main` class.
   ```java
   /** Reads the user command and executes it, until the user issues the exit command.  */
   private void runCommandLoopUntilExitCommand() {
       Command command;
       do {
           String userCommandText = ui.getUserCommand();
           command = new Parser().parseCommand(userCommandText);
           CommandResult result = executeCommand(command);
           personBook.setLastShownList(result.getRelevantPersons());
           ui.showResultToUser(result);

       } while (!ExitCommand.isExit(command));
   }
   ```
1. Use the debugger to step through the code while explaining how the code works. Start from the `main` method.
1. Suppose the code behaves incorrectly when using the `list` command after adding two persons. Show how to set a conditional breakpoint so that execution pauses when the user types in the command `list` but doesn't pause for other commands.<br>

<div id="update-code-using-forking-workflow">
<div class="indented">

**In this activity you will be using the forking workflow to do some simple updates to the code base** while working in parallel. The objective is to ensure you know how to follow the expected working in the tP. The steps are given below:

**First, ensure that you know how the _forking workflow_ works.**

{{ embed_topic("../book/revisionControl/forkingWorkflow/text.md#body", "Textbook " + icon_embedding + " Revision Control → **Forking Workflow**", "1", indent=2) }}

**Next, add the `upstream` as a remote**: The forking workflow requires you to pull from the team repo and push to your own fork. To be able to do the former, you need to **add the team repo as a _remote_ of your clone**. Follow the instructions in the panel below to add a new remote with the _Remote name_ `upstream` (can be anything, but `upstream` is a common choice) and _URL / Path_ pointing to the team repo<br>
    e.g., `https://github.com/{{ semester }}-{{ example_team_id }}/{{ tp_repo_name }}.git` (==note the `.git` at the end==)

{{ embed_topic("../book/gitAndGithub/pull/text.md#section-working-with-multiple-remotes", "Textbook " + icon_embedding + " Git & GitHub → Pull → [extract] **Working with multiple remotes**", "2", indent=2) }}

**Now, follow these steps to update the code using the forking workflow** e.g., each person can add their details to the `docs/AboutUs.md` page:
* {{ step(1) }} Decide which update each person will do.
* {{ step(2) }} Each person,
  *  {{ step('2.a') }} create a branch (e.g., `johnDoe-AboutUs`) in their local repo.
  *  {{ step('2.b') }} do the change in the branch.
  *  {{ step('2.c') }} push the branch to their own fork.
  *  {{ step('2.d') }} create a PR from their branch in the fork to the `master` branch of the team repo.
* {{ step(3) }} Work as a team to merge one PR at a time.
  * If a PR cannot be merged due to conflicts, resolve conflicts as you go (PR conflict resolution was covered in the week 6 lecture activity).
  * <span class="text-danger">Do not send PRs from team repo to individual repos</span> as that goes against the forking workflow. PRs should only go from forks to the team repo.
  * For reference, PR merging instructions are in the following textbook section:

{{ embed_topic("../book/gitAndGithub/managePRs/text.md#body", "Textbook " + icon_embedding + " Git & GitHub → **Merging PRs**", "1", indent=4) }}

* {{ step(4) }} Everyone sync their local repo and the fork with the team repo (see the last paragraph in the panel above)

<small>[Image source: [this article](https://www.deekit.com/7-reasons-why-engineers-are-the-whiteboard-artists/)]</small>
</pic>
**_Hand-drawing_ diagrams on a white-board and on paper is an important practical skill** %%(e.g., for technical interviews, project discussions)%%. It's possible that the diagrams you draw in your first few attempts to look amateurish, messy, and hard to read, and the drawing itself will take a long time. With more practice, you will be able to draw such diagrams quicker %%(e.g., draw as you explain verbally your design)%%, with less need for corrections, and the diagrams will look more _professional_ too.

That is why we have structured these tutorials to get everyone to practice this skill so that **your first few (not-so-good) diagram drawing experiences happen in the tutorial, not in an interview or during your internship.**

Note the following:
* Draw ==on paper or on a whiteboard or use a free-hand drawing software== (e.g., Bamboo paper). If latter, do not use UML software or predefined shapes.
* For the same reason, don't use rulers.
* When the tutor asks you to, take a screenshot or a photo of the drawing and post in the _tutorial workspace_ document.
* {{ icon_tip }} There are mobile apps ([example](https://apps.apple.com/sg/app/evernote-scannable/id883338188)) that can take a photo of a document and and convert it to a high-quality scan.
