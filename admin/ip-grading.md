**iP serves mostly a _formative_ role in this course** i.e., it aims to ensure everyone has achieved a basic competency level that is a prerequisite to survive the tP (it does not aim to rank you based on strength or differentiate strong programmers from the rest). Hence, it is graded somewhat like an S/U component and almost everyone is expected to receive full marks for the iP.

****Full marks for the iP is `{{ marks_ip }}`****.{.text-info}

* **Meeting the bars specified below for each aspect** will earn you full  `{{ marks_ip }}` marks for iP.
* **Falling below the bars specified for _any_ of the aspects below** will limit your iP score to less than half the marks in that aspect.{.text-danger}

That is, you either get full marks, or less than half the marks for each aspect.

##### :fas-trophy: Implementation [`{{ marks_ip_implementation }}` marks]{.text-info}

* **More than 90% of all deliverables** completed.<br>
    Requirements marked as <span class="badge rounded-pill bg-secondary">optional</span> or <span class="badge rounded-pill bg-secondary">if-applicable</span> are not counted when calculating the percentage of deliverables.<br>
    When a requirement specifies a `minimal` version of it, simply reaching that minimal version of the requirement is enough for it to be counted for grading -- however, we recommend you to go beyond the minimal; the farther you go, the more practice you will get.{% if cs2103 %}
* **Has a GUI** that is at least as good as the one reached by the JavaFx tutorial !!part 4!! (i.e., no need to have features covered in part 5).{% endif %}
* **No major bugs.**
* **Reasonable use of OOP** e.g., at least some use of inheritance, code divided into classes in a sensible way (e.g., `Ui`, `Storage`, `Parser`, `Storage`, `Todo`, `Deadline`, `Event` etc.).
* **At least half of public methods/classes have javadoc comments.**
* **Reasonable code quality:**
  * No blatant violations of the coding standard (both Java and Git conventions).
  * The code is neat e.g., no chunks of commented out code.{% if cs2103 %}
  * Reasonable use of SLAP e.g., no very-long methods or deeply nested code.{% endif %}
* **At least some errors are handled using exceptions.**{% if cs2103 %}
* **At least two methods unit tested well** using JUnit.{% endif %}

##### :fas-trophy: Project Management [`{{ marks_ip_pm }}` marks]{.text-info}

* **Submitted _some_ deliverables** in at least 4 out of the {{ '5' if cs2103 else '6' }} iP weeks (i.e., week 2 - week {{ '6' if cs2103 else '7' }})
* **Followed other requirements specified** (e.g., how to use Git/GitHub for each increment, do peer reviews) in at least 4 weeks{% if cs2103 %}<br>
  {{ icon_important_big_red }} **To qualify for full marks, your last 5 iP commits need to comply with [our convention for Git commit message subject]({{ baseUrl }}/admin/standardsAndConventions.html).** If you forgot to do this, add more commits with some small tweaks to the code until you satisfy this requirement, in order to satisfy this requirement %%(Reason: doing so will help you remember this convention better in the tP, hopefully)%%. {% endif %}
