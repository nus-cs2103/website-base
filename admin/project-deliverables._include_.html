<p>To expedite your project implementation, you will be given some sample code (AddressBook-Level1 to AddressBook-Level4, shown as <code>AB1</code> to <code>AB4</code> in the diagram above) that you can use as the basis for improving your individual skills
  during Phases A and as the basis for your project in Phase B.</p>
<p><code>AB4</code> is the version you will use as the starting point for your final project. Some of the work you do in <code>AB1</code> to <code>AB3</code> can be ported over to <code>AB4</code> and can be used to claim credit in the final project.</p>
<p>The sub-sections further down explain each project deliverable in detail.</p>
