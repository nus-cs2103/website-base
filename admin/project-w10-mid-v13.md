**<big>Project Management:</big>**

* :bulb: As you move the product towards v2.0 in small steps, ensure that **each PR that adds an enhancement also updates the relevant parts of documents and tests**. That way, your documentation/testing work will not pile up towards the end.


**<big>Product:</big>**

* :exclamation: Try to **do a <tooltip content="resulting in a jar file on GitHub that can be downloaded by potential users">proper product release</tooltip>** as described in the Developer Guide. You can name it something like `v1.2.1`. Reason: You are _required_ to do a proper product release for v1.3. Doing a trial at this point will help you iron out any problems in advance.


**<big>Documentation:</big>**

* **User Guide**: Update where the document does not match the current product.
* **Developer Guide**: Similar to User Guide.

**<big>Demo:</big>**

* Optional. If you want feedback on your features, you can demo the feature and get feedback from the tutor.
