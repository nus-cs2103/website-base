  <p>CS2103T lectures are same as that for CS2103. Please ignore the CS2101 session scheduled at the same slot. That is a dummy slot used to work around a limitation on the CORS IT system. <span class="dimmed">The system doesn't allow lectures of two modules to be scheduled in the same venue at the same time.</span></p>

<p>Each lecture is a mixture of:</p>
<ul>
  <li>A <em>flipped classroom</em> format activities covering learning outcomes of the <em>current</em> week.</li>
  <li>A preview of the learning outcomes for the <em>following</em> week.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Attendance</strong>: Attendance for the <mark>first lecture is compulsory</mark>.</p>
<p><strong>Webcast</strong>: All lectures will be webcast. However, some things are not captured well in the webcast recording. You are advised to treat the webcast as a 'backup' for you to catch up anything missed during the lecture.</p>
<p><strong>Handouts</strong>: There are no handouts. All learning materials are organized around learning outcomes (not lectures or topics), are given in Web format, and can be found in the <a href="/website-base/book/index.html">Textbook</a> section and
  are also hyperlinked from the <a href="/website-base/schedule/index.html">Schedule Page</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Slides</strong>: Our lecture slides are not suited for printing or using as a reference during the lecture/exams. They are only an aid for lecture delivery. Slides will be uploaded <em>after</em> the lecture (link available in the <a href="/website-base/schedule/index.html">Schedule Page</a>).</p>
