**The lecture+tutorial slot ({{ day_lecture }} 6.30pm-9.30pm) will be repurposed** as follows, due to this being a 100% project module:

* **6.30-7pm**: No formal activities. Work with team members and consult instructors (using the MS Teams app) if you need help with the previous week's tasks.
* **7-7.30pm**: Weekly briefing, done via Zoom. The Zoom link can be found in [LumiNUS WebLinks](https://luminus.nus.edu.sg/modules/{{ luminus_module_id }}/details/web-links).
* **7.30-9.30pm**:
  * Do the lecture activities (if any) or weekly project activities.
  * You may approach instructors (using the MS Teams app) for help during this period.
  * After the team project has started, we'll be scheduling team meetings during this period, for the teaching team to discuss the project progress with you.<br>
    These meetings will be done through MS Teams app. ==If your team prefer face-to-face team meetings instead==, let us know in advance so that the teaching team can meet your team in LT19 instead.
