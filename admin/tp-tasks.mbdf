Similarly, a requirement for milestone `n` is also an implicit requirement for milestone `n+1` unless `n+1` overrides the `n` requirement.

* **User stories for what version?** At this stage, collect user stories to cover at least the final version you hope to deliver at the end of the semester. It is OK to go even beyond that %%(reason: we are simulating a project that will continue even after the semester is over)%%.{% if cs2103 or tic4002 %}<br>
  Do not omit user stories already covered by the features in AB3 %%i.e., the user story should be recorded even if AB3 already caters for it.%%{% endif %}

* **How many user stories?** Aim to collect more user stories than you can deliver in the project. %%Aim to create at least 30 user stories. Include all 'obvious' ones you can think of but also look for 'non obvious' ones that you think are likely to be missed by other competing products.%%

* **User stories of what size?** Normally, it is fine to use _epic_-level user stories in the early stages of a project but given this is a small project, you may want to define smaller user stories (i.e., small enough for one person to implement in 1-2 days).
  * {{ bad }} As a user, I can track my schedule, so that I can know when to do things.<br>
    %%Reason: too big, as _track_ can involve a lot of things.%%

  * {{ good }} As a user, I can see the pending task that has the next earliest deadline, so that I can know what I need to do next.

* **What format?**: You may use a sentence format or a table format but do maintain the prescribed three-part structure of a user story. In particular, ==try to include the _benefit_ part in most user stories== as that will come in handy when prioritizing user stories later.

* **How to record?**<br>
  ==Keep records of intermediate steps (e.g., persona, scenarios)== in your collaborative project document started in the previous week.<br>
  You can ~~write each user story in a piece of paper (e.g. yellow sticky note, index card, or just pieces of paper about the size of a playing card).

##### <span class="text-success">Project planning, with a twist</span>

Intuitively, you might think the right thing to do is to decide what features will be in {{ version_final }} and then plan the intermediate versions based on that. But that's not what we are going to do.

Why? Given the difficulty of reliably estimating the effort each feature will need, any such long-range plan is likely to be inaccurate.

Instead, what we will do is to ==assume the current iteration is the last iteration==, plan that iteration to deliver the product (based on available time), and try to follow that plan as best as we can. After the iteration is over, we plan the next iteration as if _it's_ the last iteration. But that time, you can factor in the experience from the previous iteration to do a better job of planning.

How is that better?
* Shorter-term plans have a better chance of being accurate and doable.
* You get multiple clean shots at project planning. Each try can learn from the previous tries. Hence, more learning.
* As each iteration produces a working product, you always have a working product, which practically eliminates the risk failing to deliver a working product by the final deadline.

</box>

**The goal of this activity is to come up with the _smallest possible product that is still usable_** so that it can be implemented as {{ version_first }}, to be delivered at the end of the first project iteration. We try to make it small because ==you will have only two weeks to implement {{ version_first }}== and coding as a team is a lot harder than writing code alone.

{{ icon_important_big_red }} Do not discuss features, UI, command format, or implementation details yet. That would be like _putting the cart before the horse_. At this stage we are simply trying to choose which user needs to fulfill first.

</div>

* If the product _can_ be of some use without a given user story, that user story should be left out of {{ version_first }}, even if the omission makes the product hard to use, as long as the product is not _impossible_ to use %%e.g., in most cases a product can be used without an 'edit item' feature because the user can always delete an item and add a new item instead of editing an existing an item%%.
* Don't worry about {{ version_penultimate  }}. You can design {{ version_penultimate }} after {{ version_first }} done.
* Don't worry about {{ version_first }} being 'too small'. You can always add more features to {{ version_first }} if you finish it ahead of schedule.<br>
  {{ icon_tip }} You can also select an additional set of user stories that are _nice-to-have_ in v1.2, to be done but only if there's time left.
* If possible, narrow the scope of {{ version_first }} further e.g., narrower target user, a smaller value proposition.

Suggested workflow:
* **First stage**:
  * Divide the user stories among team members.
  * Each member will go through their user stories to discard (e.g., cross out, or move to a different location, but not delete) which are _definitely not needed_ for {{ version_first }}.
* **Second stage**:
  * All members discuss the remaining user stories (i.e., the ones not discarded in the first stage), and try to trim the list further.

* **README** page: Update it to match your project.

  * Add a UI mockup of your intended final product.
    Note that the ==image of the UI should be `docs/images/Ui.png`== so that it can be downloaded by our scripts.

    {{ icon_tip }} If you did the above update correctly, UI mock up and profile photos should appear in your project website and this [**Project List Page**]({{ url_team_list }}).

  * Update all contents to match your own project.

  * Update the link of the GitHub Actions _build status badge_ (<img src="https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/workflows/Java%20CI/badge.svg" alt="Build Status">) so that it reflects the build status of your team repo.

  * Acknowledge the original source of the code e.g.,<br>
    `This project is based on the AddressBook-Level3 project created by the [SE-EDU initiative](https://se-education.org).`

* **Update site-wide settings** as described in the guide [_Using Jekyll for project documentation_ @SE-EDU/guides](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/jekyll.html).<br>

* {{ icon_team }} **Plan the next iteration**. As you know, you should follow the _breadth-first iterative_ process. Therefore, first you must decide what functionalities should be in the product if you had only two weeks to implement it. You have done that already when you chose user stories for {{ version_first }}, translated that to features, and even drafted the UG based on those features. You can tweak that plan further at this point if you wish, given that you now have some idea of how fast the team can work when using the prescribed workflow.
  * ==**Aim to produce a _working_ [MVP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_viable_product)**== at the end of this iteration even if the functionalities are not polished (polishing can be done in a later iteration).
  * **If possible, break the iteration into two _increments_** i.e., aim to produce an even simpler but working version after one week.
  * **Avoid depth-first implementations**: "I'll do the back-end part of feature X in this iteration" is not acceptable as that is not in the spirit of iterative development. Remember, we are pretending this to be the last iteration; why would you implement the back-end part of a feature in the last iteration?<br>
    It is OK to add simpler versions of bigger features, but not OK to add partial features that can't be used yet.
* {{ icon_team }} **Divide the work among the team members** i.e., the work required for the current iteration.
* {{ icon_individual }} **Reflect the above plan in the issue tracker** by assigning the corresponding issues (create new issues if necessary) to yourself and to the corresponding milestone. %%For example, the user story pertaining to the increment `show a place holder for photo, showing a generic default image` should be assigned to Jake and to milestone `{{ version_first }}`%%<br>

   If the app asks for public repo access permissions, grant it (just go with the default settings).
1. **Let CATcher create a repo named `alpha`** in your GitHub account, when it asks for permission. That repo will be used to hold the bug reports you will create in this testing session.
1. **Use the app (not the GitHub Web interface) to create 1-2 dummy bug reports**. The steps are similar to how you would enter bug reports in the GitHub issue tracker. Include at least one screenshot in one of those bug reports.<br>
   {{ icon_tip }} you can ==copy-paste screenshots== into the bug description.<br>
   {{ icon_tip }} You can use Markdown syntax in the bug descriptions.<br>
   {{ icon_info }} The `severity` and `type` labels are compulsory.
1. **Report any problems you encounter** at the [CATcher issue tracker](https://github.com/CATcher-org/CATcher/issues).
1. **Do NOT delete the `alpha` repo** created by CATcher in your GitHub account (keep it until the end of the semester) as our scripts will look for it later to check if you have done this activity.

**The goal of freezing features in the pre-release iteration** is to subject the features to at least one round of intensive non-dev testing before they are released to the users. In a real project, minor or critical changes might be allowed even near a deadline -- but here, we do not allow _any_ feature changes because it can start us on a slippery slope and many "is this change allowed?" queries. Therefore, {{ version_final }} should not have _any_ features that was not already tested in the PE-D).

**FAQs:**
* **Q:** Can we add a missing validity check for a user input?<br>
**A:** Yes, but only if its absence causes the software to mis-behave (i.e., it's omission can be considered a bug).
* **Q:** Testers have reported a missing feature (or a feature suggestion). Can we add it?<br>
**A:** Most teams receive such suggestions from testers as we allow feature suggestions in PE-D (but they are not allowed in the PE). You can use those suggestions when you envision future versions of the product (i.e., beyond {{ version_final }} -- to improve your product design skills. But for now, focus on fixing bugs, and perfecting other aspects such as testing, documentation, code quality.<br>
Also note that given there's a feature freeze in {{ version_final }}, some lower-priority features can be argued as out-of-scope if there were other higher priority features that took up the available time in previous versions. Every team has to draw the line _somewhere_ as there wasn't a lot of time to implement features.

<!--
* **Venue:** Same as the tutorial venue unless informed otherwise. You'll be using the TV at your regular tutorial table (not the projector) for the demo.
* **Schedule:** Your demo timing is same as your tutorial time in week 13.
  * Teams `1` and `3` will start at 05-minutes mark (e.g., 11.05 am), and teams `2` and `4` start at 30-minutes mark (e.g., 11.30 am).
  * Please ==arrive _before_ time== and remain outside the venue until called in. Late arrival or absence is liable to a penalty.
  * Any delay in starting the presentation is deducted out of your time allotment %%e.g., if you are scheduled to demo at 11.05-11.23 am (i.e., 18 minutes), you'll have to stop at 11.23 am even if you start at 11.10 am.%%
* You should bring your own adapter if the display adapters available in your tutorial venue don't work for you.
