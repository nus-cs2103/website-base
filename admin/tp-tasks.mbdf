{{ icon_important_big_red }} **Milestone requirements are cumulative**. The recommended progress for the mid-milestone is an implicit requirement for the actual milestone unless a milestone requirement overrides a mid-milestone requirement %%e.g., mid-milestone requires a document to be in a temp format while the actual milestone requires it to be in the proper format%%. Similarly, a requirement for milestone `n` is also an implicit requirement for milestone `n+1` unless `n+1` overrides the `n` requirement. This means ==if you miss some requirement at milestone `n`, you should try to achieve it before milestone `n+1`== or else it could be noted again as a 'missed requirement' at milestone `n+1`.

Some things to note as you start the {{ version_penultimate }} iteration:
* **Set moderate targets for functionality.** Adding more functionality than needed will not earn you more marks but can expose you to higher risk of bugs.<br>
  **Focus on improving the process and the quality** instead.
* **Move in small steps, and keep the product working at each step.** If it breaks, you will only have to examine the latest change for the cause of the breakage.

**The goal of this activity is to come up with the _smallest possible product that is still usable_** so that it can be implemented as {{ version_first }}. We try to make it small because you will have only two weeks to implement {{ version_first }} and coding as a team is a lot harder than writing code alone.
* If the product _can_ be of some use without a given user story, that user story should be left out of {{ version_first }}, even if the omission makes the product hard to use, as long as the product is not _impossible_ to use %%e.g., in most cases a product can be used without an 'edit item' feature because the user can always delete an item and add a new item instead of editing an existing an item%%.
* Don't worry about {{ version_penultimate  }}. You can design {{ version_penultimate }} after {{ version_first }} done.
* Don't worry about {{ version_first }} being 'too small'. You can always add more features to {{ version_first }} if you finish it ahead of schedule.
* If possible, narrow the scope of {{ version_first }} further e.g., narrower target user, a smaller value proposition.

Suggested workflow:
* **First stage** [10 minutes]:
  * Divide the user stories among team members.
  * Each member will go through their user stories to discard (e.g., cross out, or move to a different location, but not delete) which are _definitely not needed for {{ version_first }}_.
* **Second stage** [10 minutes]:
  * All members discuss the remaining user stories (i.e., the ones not discarded in the first stage), and try to trim the list further.

  * Add a UI mockup of your intended final product.
    Note that the ==image of the UI should be `docs/images/Ui.png`== so that it can be downloaded by our scripts.

##### <span class="text-success">Project planning, but with a twist</span>

Intuitively, you might thing the right thing to do is to decide what features will be in {{ version_final }} and then plan the intermediate versions based on that. But that's not what we are going to do.

Why? You don't have enough experience to reliably estimate effort each feature will need, and hence, any such long range plan is likely to be inaccurate.

Instead, what we will do is to ==assume the current iteration is the last iteration==, plan that iteration accordingly, and try to follow that plan as best as we can. After the iteration is over, we plan the next iteration as if _it's_ the last iteration. But that time, factor in the experience from the previous iteration to do a better job of planning.

How is that better?
* Shorter-term plans have a better chance of being accurate and doable.
* You get multiple clean shots at project planning. Each try can learn from the previous tries. Hence, more learning.
* As each iteration produces a working product, you always have a working product, which reduces the risk overshooting the final deadline.

</box>

</div>

* {{ icon_team }} **Plan the next iteration**. As per the project planning approach described in the box above, first you must decide what functionalities should be in the product if you had only two weeks to implement it. You have done that already when you chose user stories for {{ version_first }}, translated that to features, and even drafted the UG based on those features. You can tweak that plan further at this point if you wish, given that you now have some idea of how fast the team can work when using the prescribed workflow.
  * ==Aim to produce a _working_ [MVP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_viable_product)== at the end of this iteration even if the functionalities are not polished (polishing can be done in a later iteration).
  * If possible, break the iteration into two increments i.e., aim to produce an even simpler but working version after one week.
  * "I'll do the back-end part of feature X in this iteration" is not acceptable as that is not in the spirit of iterative development. Remember, we are pretending this to be the last iteration; why would you implement the back-end part of a feature in the last iteration?<br>
    It is OK to add simpler versions of bigger features, but not OK to add partial features that can't be used yet i.e., go _breadth-first iterative_ not _depth-first iterative_.
* {{ icon_team }} **Divide the work** (i.e., the work required to produce that version) among the team members.
* {{ icon_individual }} **Divide the work assigned to you into at least two increments** i.e., have at least one task to do in each of the coming two weeks.
* {{ icon_individual }} **Reflect the above plan in the issue tracker** by assigning the corresponding issues (create new issues if necessary) to yourself and to the corresponding milestone. %%For example, the user story pertaining to the increment `show a place holder for photo, showing a generic default image` should be assigned to Jake and to milestone `v1.2`%%<br>
  Optionally, you can define a `mid-v1.2` milestone to keep track of things to be done within the first half of the milestone.

The version you deliver in this iteration (i.e., {{ version_penultimate }}) will be subjected a peer testing (aka [PE Dry Run](tp-pe.html#tp-practical-exam-dry-run-pe-d)) and you will be informed of the bugs they find (no penalty for those bugs).

You can use the final iteration for fixing the bugs found by peer testers.

Furthermore, the final iteration (i.e., the one after this) will be shorter than usual and there'll be a lot of additional things to do during that iteration e.g., polishing up documentation; all the more reason to try and get all the implementation work done in this iteration itself.

<!--
* **Venue:** Same as the tutorial venue unless informed otherwise. You'll be using the TV at your regular tutorial table (not the projector) for the demo.
* **Schedule:** Your demo timing is same as your tutorial time in week 13.
  * Teams `1` and `3` will start at 05-minutes mark (e.g., 11.05 am), and teams `2` and `4` start at 30-minutes mark (e.g., 11.30 am).
  * Please ==arrive _before_ time== and remain outside the venue until called in. Late arrival or absence is liable to a penalty.
  * Any delay in starting the presentation is deducted out of your time allotment %%e.g., if you are scheduled to demo at 11.05-11.23 am (i.e., 18 minutes), you'll have to stop at 11.23 am even if you start at 11.10 am.%%
* You should bring your own adapter if the display adapters available in your tutorial venue don't work for you.
