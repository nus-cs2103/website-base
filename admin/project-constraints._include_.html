<p>Your project should comply with the following constraints.
  <span class="dimmed"><strong>Reason</strong></span>: to increase comparability among submissions and to maximize applicability of module content in the project.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Constraint-Morph</strong>: The final product should be a result of morphing the given code base. i.e. enhance and/or evolve the given code to arrive at the new software. However, you are allowed to replace all existing code with new code, as
    long as it is done incrementally. <span class="dimmed">e.g. one feature/component at a time</span><br><span class="dimmed"><strong>Reason:</strong> To ensure your code has a decent quality level from the start.</span></li>
</ul>
<span id="constraint-cli"><ul><li><strong>Constraint-CLI</strong>: Command Line Interface is the primary mode of input. The GUI should be used primarily to give visual feedback to the user rather than to collect input. Some minimal use of mouse is OK (e.g. to click the minimize button), but the primary input should be command-driven. Mouse actions should have keyboard alternatives and typing is preferred over key combinations. Design the app in a way that you can do stuff faster by typing compared to mouse or key combinations.</li></ul></span>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Constraint-Human-Editable-File</strong>: The data should be stored locally and should be in a human editable text file. Use of relational or No-SQL databases are not allowed.<br><span class="dimmed"><strong>Reason:</strong> To allow advanced users to manipulate the data by editing the data file.</span></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Constraint-OO</strong>: The software should follow the Object-oriented paradigm.<br><span class="dimmed"><strong>Reason:</strong> For you to practice OOP that you learned in the course.</span></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Constraint-Windows</strong>: The software should work on the Windows platform.<br><span class="dimmed"><strong>Reason:</strong> Final testing will be done on Windows machines.</span></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Constraint-No-Installer</strong>: The software should work without requiring an installer. Having an optional installer is OK as longs as the portable (non-installed) version has all the critical functionality.<br><span class="dimmed"><strong>Reason:</strong> We do not want to install all your projects on our testing machines when we test them for grading.</span></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Constraint-External-Software</strong>: The use of third-party frameworks/libraries is allowed but only if they,</p>
    <ul>
      <li>are free.</li>
      <li>do not require any installation by the user of your software.</li>
      <li>do not violate other constraints.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>and is subjected to prior approval by us.<br><span class="dimmed"><strong>Reason:</strong> We will not allow third-party software that can interfere with the learning objectives of the module.</span></p>
    <p>Please post your request for approval in IVLE forum before you start using the library.<br><span class="dimmed"><strong>Reason:</strong> The whole class should know which external software are used by others so that they can do the same if they wish to.</span></p>
