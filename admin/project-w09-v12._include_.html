          <h2 id="project-schedule-tracking">Project Schedule Tracking</h2>
          <p>In general, use the issue tracker (Milestones, Issues, PRs, Tags, Releases, and Labels) for assigning, scheduling, and tracking <em>all</em> noteworthy project tasks, including user stories. Update the issue tracker regularly to reflect the
            current status of the project. You can also use GitHub's new <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6MGKHkNtxU">Projects feature</a> to manage the project, but keep it linked to the issue tracker as much as you can.</p>
          <h3 id="using-issues">Using Issues:</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p><strong>Record each of the user stories you plan to deliver as an issue in the issue tracker.</strong>
                <span class="dimmed">e.g.</span> <code>Title: As a user I can add a deadline</code><br>
                <code>Description: ... so that I can keep track of my deadlines</code></p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p><strong>Assign the <code>type.*</code> and <code>priority.*</code> labels to those issues.</strong></p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p><strong>When you start implementing a story, break it down to tasks.</strong> Define reasonable sized, standalone tasks. A task should be able to done by one person, in a few hours. <span class="dimmed">e.g.</span></p>
              <ul>
                <li><span class="dimmed">👍 Good: Update class diagram in the project manual for v1.4</span></li>
                <li><span class="dimmed">👎 Bad (reasons: not a one-person task, not small enough): Write the project manual</span></li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p><strong>Write a descriptive title for the issue.</strong> <span class="dimmed">e.g. Add support for the 'undo' command to the parser.</span></p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p><strong>There is no need to break things into VERY small tasks.</strong> Keep them as big as possible, but they should be no bigger than what you are going to assign a single person to do within a week. <span class="dimmed">eg.,</span></p>
              <ul>
                <li><code>Implementing parser</code>  <span class="dimmed">: too big because it cannot be done by a single person in a week.</span></li>
                <li><code>Implementing parser support for adding of floating tasks</code> <span class="dimmed">: appropriate size.</span></li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p><strong>Do not track things taken for granted.</strong> <span class="dimmed">e.g., <code>push code to repo</code> should not be a task to track. In the example given under the previous point, it is taken for granted that the owner will also (a) test the code and (b) push to the repo when it is ready. Those two need not be tracked as separate tasks.</span></p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p><strong>Omit redundant details.</strong> In some cases, the summary/title is enough to describe the task. In that case, no need to repeat it in the description. There is no need for well-crafted and detailed descriptions for tasks. A minimal
                description is enough. Similarly, labels such as <code>priority</code> can be omitted if you think they don't help you.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p><strong>Assign tasks to team members using the <code>assignees</code> field.</strong> At any point, there should be some ongoing tasks and some pending tasks against each team member.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p><strong>Optionally, you can use <code>status.ongoing</code> label to indicate issues currently ongoing.</strong></p>

              </li>
              <li>
                <p>Set the deadlines for milestones (in GitHub). Your internal milestones can be set earlier than the deadlines we have set, to give you a buffer.</p>
              </li>

              <mark>Here are the conditions to satisfy for a milestone to be considered properly wrapped up</mark>:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <p>A working product tagged with the correct tag (e.g. v1.2) is pushed to the main repo.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>All tests passing on Travis for the version tagged above.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>Milestone updated to match the product i.e. all issues completed and PRs merged for the milestone should be assigned to the milestone.<br>

              </li>
              <li>
                <p>Milestone closed. If there are incomplete issues or unmerged PRs in the milestone, move them to a future milestone.<br>

              </li>
              <li>
                <p>Optionally, issues for the next milestone are assigned to team members (this is not compulsory to do <em>before</em> the tutorial, but we recommend you to do it soon after the tutorial).</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>Optionally, future milestones are revised based on what you experienced in the current milestone <span class="dimmed"> e.g. if you could not finish all issues assigned to the current milestone, it is a sign that you overestimated how much you can do in a week, which means you might want to reduce the issues assigned to future milestones to match that observation</span>.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>Doing a 'release' on GitHub is optional for v1.1 and v1.2 but compulsory from v1.3.</p>

        <p>💡 We use a tool called <em>Collate</em> to extract out code written by each member in your final project submission. The tool requires you to annotate code with special tags to mark code written by you. Adding those annotations is usually done
          at v1.3 but you are welcome to start early.</p>
        <panel header="**How to collate code for grading**" no-close="">
          <div>Collate is a tool for collating code written by different developers.
            <p>Steps to use Collate:</p>
            <ol>
              <li>Download <code>Collate-TUI.jar</code> from the <a href="https://github.com/se-edu/collate">Collate Tool project</a></li>
              <li>Annotate your code to indicate who wrote which part of the code (instructions given below)</li>
              <li>Run the Collate tool to collate code written by each person into separate files (instructions given below)</li>
            </ol>
            <h4 id="annotating-code-to-indicate-authorship">Annotating code to indicate authorship</h4>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <p>Mark your code with a <code>//@@author {yourGithubUsername}</code>. Note the double <code>@</code>.<br> The <code>//@@author</code> tag should appear only at the beginning of the code you wrote. The code up to the next <code>//@@author</code>                  tag or the end of the file (whichever comes first) will be considered as was written by that author. Here is a sample code file:</p>
                <pre class="hljs"><code>//@@author johndoe
method 1 ...
method 2 ...
//@@author sarahkhoo
method 3 ...
//@@author johndoe
method 4 ...
</code></pre>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p><strong>If you don't know who wrote the code segment below yours</strong>, you may put an empty <code>//@@author</code> (i.e. no GitHub username) to indicate the end of the code segment you wrote. The author of code below yours can add
                  the GitHub username to the empty tag later. Here is a sample code with an empty <code>author</code> tag:</p>
                <pre class="hljs"><code>method 0 ...
//@@author johndoe
method 1 ...
method 2 ...
//@@author

              </li>
              <li>
                <p><strong>The author tag syntax varies based on file type</strong> e.g. for java, css, fxml. Use the corresponding comment syntax for non-Java files.<br> Here is an example code from an xml file.</p>
                <pre class="hljs"><code>&lt;!-- @@author sereneWong --&gt;

                <ul>
                  <li>If an enhancement required you to do tiny changes in many places, there is no need to collate all those tiny changes; you can describe those changes in the Project Portfolio page instead.</li>
                  <li>If a code block was touched by more than one person, either let the person who wrote most of it (e.g. more than 80%) take credit for the entire block, or leave it as 'unclaimed' (i.e., no author tags).</li>
                  <li>Related to the above point, <mark>if you claim a code block as your own, more than 80% of the code in that block should have been written by yourself</mark>. For example, no more than 20% of it can be code you reused from somewhere.</li>
                  <li>💡 GitHub has a <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/tracing-changes-in-a-file/"><em>blame</em> feature and a <em>history</em></a> feature that can help you determine who wrote a piece of code.</li>

                  blocks within test methods should be extracted out as utility methods to reduce code duplication.<br> Individual members are responsible for making sure their own collated files contain the correct content.<br> If you notice a team member
                  claiming credit for code that he/she did not write or use other questionable tactics, you can email us (after the final submission) to let us know.</p>

            <li><mark>Each member should describe the implementation of at least one enhancement she has added</mark> (or planning to add). <br> Expected length: 1+ page per person</li>
            <li>The description can contain things such as,
              <ul>
                <li>How the feature is implemented.</li>
                <li>Why it is implemented that way.</li>

            <li>The stated objective is to explain the implementation to a future developer, but a hidden objective is to show evidence that you can document deeply-technical content using prose, examples, diagrams, code snippets, etc. appropriately. To that
              end, you may also describe features that you plan to implement in the future, even beyond v1.4 (hypothetically).</li>
            <li>For an example, see <a href="https://nus-cs2103-ay1718s2.github.io/addressbook-level4/DeveloperGuide.html#undo-redo-feature">the description of the undo/redo feature implementation in the AddressBook-Level4 developer guide</a>.</li>
