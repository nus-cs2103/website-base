#### <span class="badge badge-success">PE</span> <span class="text-success">Overview</span>

<div id="pe-overview">

* **The upfront objective of the PE is to increase the rigor of project grading.** Assessing most aspects of the project involves an element subjectivity. As the project counts for a large percentage of the final grade, it is not prudent to rely on evaluations of tutors alone as there can be significant variations between how different tutors assess projects. That is why we collect more data points via the PE so as to minimize the chance of your project being affected by evaluator-bias.
* **PE mainly evaluates your testing skills**, done as the following two-parts:
  1. **You will be given a chance to find bugs in a different software.** Furthermore, you will be given an opportunity to defend your bug reports against any possible objections. If you can successfully find bugs and defend them against any objections, you earn marks (provided the product actually had bugs in the first place).
  2. **Your product will be subjected to a rigorous testing** and you will be given a chance to object to any bugs reported. You will lose marks for any bugs that turned out to be real bugs, but only if your work has more bugs than a certain bar.
* **The above two can lead to high-rigor, <tooltip content="based on how well you achieve the objectives of testing, as opposed to indirect measures such as number of test cases">_outcome-based_</tooltip> evaluation of your testing skills**. The alternative is to rely solely on other easy-to-measure metrics %%(e.g., the number of test cases, test coverage, test LoC etc.)%% which we don't think is right, given how important the testing aspect is.
**The _ultimate_ objective of the PE is not even the higher rigor of grading.** Because of the PE, you will realize that any bugs are very likely to be detected, which means you ==will work extra hard to avoid bugs; and THAT is the real benefit==.
* **Problem: There is no way we can carry out the above-mentioned** two-part evaluation at a high-level of rigor if using tutors as testers, or using an automated testing script. %%e.g., some tutors might not have the motivation to try hard enough to find bugs, and it will be hard to find tutors willing to spend many hours testing products so near to their own exams.%%<br>
  **Solution: Get the two parts of the evaluation to feed each other** by getting student to test each others' products.
* **The fact that you are testing products created by your classmates and objecting to bugs reported by your classmates can makes this a rather 'unpleasant' experience**. You might feel like _being pitted against each other_, or as if _you are forced to bring down each other_. But as you read above, it is a necessary evil for this evaluation to be even possible. Given the actual goal is to get you to create products with very few bugs, we think switching off the 'collaborative learning' mode for just a few days is a price worth paying to achieve that goal. After all, the PE is an evaluation activity (not a _learning activity_) and happens _after_ the regular learning period is over.
* **You are not taking marks from someone else** -- at least, don't think of it that way. The point of contention is 'is this really a bug?' which is independent of the people involved. Furthermore, the reward for detecting a bug and the penalty for having a bug in your code are calculated independently.
* **Still, _none of us_ likes it when others point out problems of our work**. Some of us don't even like pointing out problems of others' work. But ==we just have to learn not to take bug reports personally==. Another important lesson is to learn how to report bugs in a way that doesn't feel like you are _attacking_ or trying to _sabotage_ the dev team.
* **PE also evaluates aspects other than testing** e.g., your product evaluation skills, effort estimation skills etc. When evaluating those aspects in particular, they ==not graded solely based on peer ratings==. Rather, PE data are cross-validated with tutors' grades to identify cases that need further investigation. When peer inputs are used for grading, they are usually combined with tutors' grades with appropriate weight for each. In some cases ratings from team members are given a higher weight compared to ratings from other peers, if that is appropriate.

* **Grading**:
  * Your performance in the practical exam will affect your final grade and your peers', as explained in [_Admin: Project Grading_]({{ baseUrl }}/admin/tp-grading.html) section.
  * As such, we have put in measures to identify and ==penalize insincere/random evaluations==.

#### <span class="badge badge-success">PE</span> <span class="text-success">Phase 2: Developer Response</span>

==**Deadline:** {{ get_date(date_w13_start, 10) }}==

This phase is for you to respond to the bug reports you received.

<box type="tip" seamless>

**Bonus marks for high accuracy rates!**{.text-success}

You will receive bonus marks if a high percentage (e.g., >80%) of bugs are _**accepted as triaged**_ (i.e., the eventual `type.*`, `severity.*`, and `response.*` of the bug match the ones you chose).
</box>

Duration: The review period will start around 1 day after the PE and will last for 2-3 days (exact times will be announced later). However, you are recommended to finish this task ASAP, to minimize cutting into your exam preparation work.

Bug reviewing is recommended to be done as a team as some of the decisions need team consensus.

<box>

**Instructions for Reviewing Bug Reports**

* **Don't freak out if there are lot of bug reports.** Many can be duplicates and some can be _false positives_. In any case, we anticipate that all of these products will have some bugs and our penalty for bugs is not harsh. Furthermore, it depends on the severity of the bug. Some bug may not even be penalized.
* As mentioned earlier, the penalty for having a specific bug is not the same as the reward for reporting that bug (it's not a _zero-sum_ game). For example, the reward for testers will be higher (because we don't expect the products to have that many bugs after they have gone through so much prior testing)

<box type="info" seamless>

**Penalty for a minor bug (e.g., <tooltip content="an indicative value only; the actual value depends on the severity, type, and the number of assignees">-0.15</tooltip>) is unlikely to make a difference in your final grade**, especially given that the penalty applies only if you have more than a certain amount of bugs.<br>

For example, in a typical case a developer might assigned 5+ `severity.VeryLow` bugs before the penalty even starts affecting their marks.

Accordingly, we hope you'll **accept bug reports graciously** (rather than fight tooth-and-nail to reject _every_ bug report received) if you think the bug is within the ballpark of 'reasonable'. Those minor bugs are really not worth stressing/fighting over.
</box>


<tabs>
<tab header="Using CATcher">

<box type="info" icon=":fas-hard-hat:">

* CATcher does not come with a UG, but the UI is fairly intuitive (there are tool tips too). Do post in the forum if you need any guidance with its usage.
* Also note that CATcher hasn't been battle-tested for this phase, in particular, w.r.t. multiple team members editing the same issue concurrently. It is ideal if the team members get together and work through the issues together. If you think others might be editing the same issues at the same time, use the `Sync` button at the top to force-sync your view with the latest data from GitHub.
</box>

* Go to [CATcher Web app](https://catcher-org.github.io/CATcher/), and login to the profile `{{ module_pair }} PE`. It will show all the bugs assigned to your team, divided into three sections:
  1. `Issues Pending Responses` - Issues that your team has not processed yet.
  1. `Issues Responded` - Your job is to get all issues to this category.
  1. `Faulty Issues` - e.g., Bugs marked as duplicates of each other, or causing circular _duplicate_ relationships. Fix the problem given so that no issues remain in this category.
* Respond to the bug reports shown.

<div class="indented-less">

**You must use CATcher. You are strictly prohibited from editing PE bug reports using the GitHub Web interface** as it can can render bug reports unprocessable by CATcher, sometimes in an irreversible ways, and can affect the entire class. Please contact the prof if you are unable to use CATcher for some reason.
</box>
</div>

</div>
</tab>

<p/>

* **If a bug seems to be for a different product** (i.e. wrongly assigned to your team), let us know ASAP.
* **If the bug is reported multiple times**,
  * Mark <span class="text-danger">all copies ==EXCEPT one==</span> as duplicates of the one left out (let's call that one the _original_) using the :fas-check-square: `A Duplicate of` tick box.
  * For each group of duplicates, all duplicates should point to one _original_ i.e., no multiple levels of duplicates, and no cyclical duplication relationships.
  * If the duplication status is eventually accepted, all duplicates will be assumed to have inherited the `type.*` and `severity.*` from the _original_.
<p/>

* **Apply one of these labels** (if missing, we assign: `response.Accepted`)

<div class="indented">
<box>

**Response** Labels:
* `response.Accepted`: You accept it as a bug.
* `response.NotInScope`: It is a valid issue but not something the team should be penalized for %%e.g., it was not related to features delivered in {{ version_final }}%%.
* `response.Rejected`: What tester treated as a bug is in fact the _expected_ and _correct_ behavior (from the user's point of view), or the tester was mistaken in some other way.
* `response.CannotReproduce`: You are unable to reproduce the behavior reported in the bug after multiple tries.
* `response.IssueUnclear`: The issue description is not clear. Don't post comments asking the tester to give more info. The tester will not be able to see those comments because the bug reports are anonymous.

Only the `response.Accepted` bugs are counted against the dev team. While `response.NotInScope` are not counted against the dev team, they can earn a small amount of consolation marks for the tester. The other three do not affect marks of either the dev team or the tester, except when calculating bonus marks for accuracy.


</box>
</div>


* **If you disagree with the original bug type assigned to the bug**, you may change it to the correct type.

<div class="indented" id="type-labels">
<box>

**Type** labels:
* `type.FunctionalityBug`: A functionality does not work as specified/expected.
* `type.FeatureFlaw`: Some functionality missing from a feature delivered in {{ version_final }} in a way that the feature becomes less useful to the intended target user for _normal_ usage. i.e., the feature is not 'complete'. In other words, an acceptance-testing bug that falls within the scope of {{ version_final }} features. These issues are counted against the _product design_ aspect of the project.<br>
  Features that work as specified by the UG but _should have been designed to work differently_ (from the end-user's point of view) fall in this category too.
* `type.DocumentationBug`: A flaw in the documentation %%e.g., a missing step, a wrong instruction, typos%%
</box>
</div>

* **If you disagree with the original severity assigned to the bug**, you may change it to the correct level.

<div class="indented">
<include src="appendixE-gitHub.md#bug-severity" />
</div>

* **If you need the teaching team's inputs when deciding on a bug** %%(e.g., if you are not sure if the UML notation is correct)%%, post in the [forum]({{ url_forum }}). Remember to ==quote the issue number shown in CATcher== (it appears at the end of the issue title).

</div>

* **Decide who should take responsibility for the bug**. Use the `Assignees` field to assign the issue to that person(s). There is no need to actually fix the bug though. It's simply an indication/acceptance of responsibility. **If there is no assignee, we will distribute the penalty for that bug (if any) equally among all team members** %%e.g., if the penalty is -0.4 and there are 4 members, each member will be penalized -0.1%%.
  * If it is not easy to decide the assignee(s), we recommend (but not enforce) that the feature owner should be assigned bugs related to the feature, Reason: The feature owner should have defended the feature against bugs using automated tests and defensive coding techniques.
<p/>

* As far as possible, ==**choose the correct `type.*`, `severity.*`, `response.*`, assignees, and duplicate status even for bugs you are not accepting**==. Reason: your _non-acceptance_  may be rejected in a later phase, in which case we need to grade it as an accepted bug.<br>
  **If a bug's 'duplicate' status was rejected later** %%(i.e., the tester says it is not really a duplicate and the teaching team agrees with the tester)%%, it will inherit the type/severity/assignees from the 'original' bug that it was claimed to be a duplicate of.

* **Justify your response.** For all of the following cases, ==you must add a comment justifying your stance==. Testers will get to respond to all those cases and will be double-checked by the teaching team in later phases.
  * downgrading severity
  * non-acceptance of a bug
  * changing the bug type

  * severity downgraded
  * bug type changed
  * bug flagged as duplicate %%(Note that you still get credit for bugs flagged as duplicates, unless you reported both bugs yourself.
