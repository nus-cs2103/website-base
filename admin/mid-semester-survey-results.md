**:fas-comment: My comments:**


Understandably, some of you prefer live lectures (F2F or online) -- one advantage of those modes is that
 you can ask questions immediately if something is unclear.
 Another prof of F2F is the ease of receiving hands-on help for programming-related problems
 (although this doesn't apply when safe-distancing is in effect).
 Some drawbacks are higher risk of catching COVID, the time spent on travel etc.<br>
Recorded lectures have the advantage of higher-speed viewing, immediate rewind-replay,
 fewer mistakes, view at any time etc. although not being able to see the presenter's body language could
 be a drawback.<br>
So, it's hard to pick a winner among these options. Hopefully, our current mix of modes is good enough to
 keep everyone reasonably happy :-)

The feedback for the module website is generally positive but some areas to improve have been mentioned.
  Thanks for bringing those up. I will continue to try and improve the website whenever I can.<br>
  In the meantime, I thank you for your patience with the website -- it's not easy to disseminate that much
  of information in a way that fits everyone's expectations %%(e.g., some prefer more content to be more 'visual'
  while others prefer minimalistic presentation)%%,
  and I realize that ==it is not easy for you to consume that much of information== either.

**:fas-comment: My comments:**


* **If the workload is too high:** I realize this module can feel heavy, especially if you don't have prior programming
  experience, and also if you have a day job too.<br>
  That said, SE modules are usually heavy because learning SE skills needs a lot of practice.<br>
  I try to alleviate the workload problem by keeping deadlines fairly flexible and maintaining a low bar for
  the minimum you need to do to get a decent grade. 
* **If the workload is too low:**
  * Try to do more in the project: The project is open ended are you are encouraged to do as much as you want.
    You can refer to [Duke full description](https://nus-tic2002-2021.github.io/website/se-book-adapted/projectDuke/index.html) to find
    more things you can do with it.
  * Learn the optional topics: I have added a lot more optional topics to the second half of the semester.
    This means there is more to learn every week, if you have the capacity to do so.

**:fas-comment: My comments:**


* **If the pace is too fast for you:** Not to worry; thanks to the iterative approach we use for covering topics,
  you'll get multiple chances to solidify your familiarity of a topic/tool. Do what you can every week and 
  ==try not to fall too far behind== though.
* **If the pace is too slow for you:** I have add more optional topics to the second half of the semester,
  and made all pre-recorded videos for future lectures available (previously, videos were available upto only
  two weeks into the future). This means you should be able to move faster through the weeks if you wish.

<markdown>the progress of this module is too fast for me because I don't have any programming experience.
So I try to catch up on the coding part, but I don't have enough time to handle the project part. I'm still trying to figure out how to deal with Sourcetree. and what is meaningful for each function. But I believe I will catch up with the schedule. I hope the grading criteria are not too strict :)

<markdown>Everything is fine so far. However, the problem is I not sure am I on-track or really fine??

1) Since there is no feedback from the classmate and prof, i assume everyone is on-track. However, there is no way to measure my own understanding if it is correct or not.
2) Although I have submitted all the weekly exercises, but it is still uncertain on my understanding as there is no way to compare and check.

To improve:
1) please provide more weekly quiz to test our understanding and knowledge is on-track. 
2) please gives more examples to demonstrate the concepts than theory. Theory can be found in google and many other places. But we need practical example and "down-to-earth" example. 

Thank you.</markdown>

<markdown>I like the github website where it break down the code into step by step so that we learn a project developed stages.
One suggestion: it would be nice if someone (tutorial or lecturer) review our code and give feedbacks, as sometimes we might use a tedious way to implement the feature, but there might actually be a smarter way to do it.</markdown>

<markdown>Some thoughts & feedback:
* Perhaps we could start learning Design and UML (and various modelling techniques) earlier on (say before recess week) and keep revising throughout the semester.
* Hope we can cover same topics as CS2103T class. At least the theory part.
* I think students who got to this module have already done Data Structures & Algorithms, and 2 programming classes in C++. In TIC1002, we briefly studied 4 principles of OOP. While I appreciate the recap on OOP, we could probably go faster since it's not a foreign concept. We also learnt some OOP style programming in TIC1002, implementing ADT's (e.g. stack and queues) in OOP style.
* Furthermore, in the BTech group, I believe many are already working programmers, with some experience with Java, C# and similar languages. I think what we lack is not practical programming experience, but instead, the theory and rigorous way to approach Software Engineering. e.g. Design, OOP, UML, documentation writing, or any other concepts/ideas that are hard to acquire formally outside of academic setting. 
* I would have preferred more interaction with the rest of class through forums or discussions on Microsoft teams. During our intro programming class (TIC1001), the Coursemology forums were pretty active, so I know there are some people in our batch who love to help others.

Overall, so far, I will say that I am enjoying this module! Especially the open-ended-ness of the project component, which gives the flexibility to self-direct our learning and take it as deep as we want via the optional exercises.
Yet, I think the course can be even more targetted to BTech's working programmers by giving more airtime on the concepts that are hard to pick up on our own, e.g. design principles and explaining a good software design through UML and writing precise documentation. I think this is somewhat already reflected in the grading scheme with high emphasis on documentation (10%) and theory (60%); it would be great to start thinking about these things earlier on at the start of module and throughout the semester.</markdown>

<box type="info" icon=":fas-comment:" light><span class="text-info"><markdown>* I'll consider frontloading the semester a bit more next time, although I don't want to overwhelm those who are struggling at the start either.

* I've added almost all CS2103T topics to this module, although some of it are added as optional topics.

* Sounds like you did well in prior programming modules. See my comment on pace/workload above to learn how you can get more from the module.

* Second half of the semester cover more theory (after giving inexperienced students some time to catch up), and there are optional topics if you want to go deeper.

* I've enabled the Coursemology forum after you've brought up this point. I guess it was a bit too late to get students involved in it. Will do so from the start next time.

* Glad to hear you are enjoying the module. Yes, I'll try to give more things for experienced programmers in the module to do. But those things will have to be optional, as experienced programmers are a minority (about 15% in this cohort) and such experience is not formally a prerequisite of the degree program.</markdown>

<box type="info" header="++My general responses for points raised multiple times++"
 icon=":fas-comment:" icon-size="2x" light >

Given below are some general responses to points you guys raised multiple times above:


* **Looking for more programming practice?**: I'm afraid I wont be able to add more exercises this time.
  Will consider adding more optional exercises next semester.
  In the meantime, you can get more programming practice by doing more in the project.
  You can refer to [Duke full description](https://nus-tic2002-2021.github.io/website/se-book-adapted/projectDuke/index.html) to find
  more things you can do with it.
* **Looking for more feedback on code written?**: Unlike lower-level programming modules, giving specific feedback
  on code written in an SE module takes a lot more expertise/effort, and such feedback is still rather subjective.
  We do not do that in any of our SE modules.
  Instead, we train students to slowly learn how to self-judge your own code.
  In addition, we'll be teaching you some code quality guidelines that you can apply to your code later.
