            <li>Nevertheless, you are <mark>still expected to divide the components of the product among team members</mark> so that each team member is <em>in charge</em> of one or more components. While others will be modifying those components as necessary
              for the features they are implementing, your role as the <em>in charge</em> of a component is to guide others modifying that component <span class="dimmed"> (reason: you are supposed to be the most knowledgeable about that component)</span>              and protect that component from degrading <span class="dimmed"> e.g., you can review others' changes to your component and suggest possible changes</span>.</li>

  <p>Update the following pages:</p>

    <li><strong>User Guide</strong>:<br> Update the user guide to describe what the product would be like when it is at 2.0. Mark features not implemented yet as <code>Coming in v2.0</code>. You may use UI mockups where necessary.</li>

  <tip-box>
    <p>💡 It is highly recommended that you <strong>divide documentation work (in the User Guide and the Developer Guide) among team members based on enhancements/features each person would be adding</strong> <span class="dimmed"> e.g., If you are the person planing to add a feature X, you should be the person to describe the feature X in the User Guide and in the Developer Guide</span>.
      For features that are not planned to be implemented by v1.5, you can divide them based on who will be implementing them <em>if</em> the project were to continue until v2.0 (hypothetically).</p>
    <p><span class="dimmed">Reason: In the final project evaluation your documentation skills will be graded based on sections of the User/Developer Guide you have written.</span></p>

    <p><strong>Roles indicate aspects you are in charge of and responsible for.</strong> <span class="dimmed">E.g., if you are in charge of documentation, you are the person who should allocate which parts of the documentation is to be done by who, ensure the document is in right format, ensure consistency etc.</span></p>
    <p>Here are some example roles:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><em>Team lead</em>: Responsible for overall project coordination.</li>
      <li><em>Documentation</em> (short for ‘in charge of documentation’): Responsible for the quality of various project documents.</li>
      <li><em>Testing</em>: Ensures the testing of the project is done properly and on time.</li>
      <li><em>Code quality</em>: Looks after code quality, ensures adherence to coding standards, etc.</li>
      <li><em>Deliverables and deadlines</em>: Ensure project deliverables are done on time and in the right format.</li>
      <li><em>Integration</em>: In charge of versioning of the code, maintaining the code repository, integrating various parts of the software to create a whole.</li>
      <li><em>Scheduling and tracking</em>: In charge of defining, assigning, and tracking project tasks.</li>
      <li><em>[Tool ABC] expert</em>: <span class="dimmed">e.g. Intellij expert, Git expert, etc.</span> Helps other team member with matters related to the specific tool.</li>
      <li><em>In charge of[Component XYZ]</em>: <span class="dimmed">e.g. In charge of <code>Model</code>, <code>UI</code>, <code>Storage</code>, etc.</span> If you are in charge of a component, you are expected to know that component well, and review changes

    <p>You may define additional roles.</p>
    <p>Please make sure each of the important roles are assigned to one person in the team. It is OK to have a 'backup' for each role, but <strong>for each aspect there should be one person who is unequivocally the person responsible for it</strong>.</p>
