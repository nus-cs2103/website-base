    <p>There is no midterm.</p>
    <p>The final exam has two parts:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Part 1: MCQ questions (1 hour, 24 marks)</li>
      <li>Part 2: Essay questions (1 hour, 16 marks)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Both papers will be given to you at the start but you need to <strong>answer Part 1 first</strong> (i.e. MCQ paper). It will be <strong>collected 1 hour after the exam start time</strong> (even if arrived late for the exam). You are free to start
      part 2 early if you finish Part 1 early.</p>
    <h2 id="final-exam-part-1-mcq">Final Exam: Part 1 (MCQ)</h2>
    <p>Each MCQ question gives you a statement to evaluate.</p>
    <tip-box>
      <p>📦 An example statement</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>Testing is a Q&amp;A activity</p>
      </blockquote>
    </tip-box>
    <p>Unless stated otherwise, the meaning of answer options are<br>
      <strong>A.</strong> <code>True</code><br>
      <strong>B.</strong> Option not used<br>
      <strong>C.</strong> <code>Question unclear</code> (in this case, write down your doubt in the question paper)<br>
      <strong>D.</strong> Option not used<br>
      <strong>E.</strong> <code>False</code></p>
    <p><strong>Incorrect answers receive negative marks.</strong> Here is an example marking scheme:</p>
    <p>Answer correct <strong>(+0.24)</strong><br> Option <code>C</code> <strong>(0)</strong><br> No answer <strong>(0)</strong><br> Answer incorrect <strong>(-0.24)</strong><br></p>
    <p><span class="dimmed"> Negative marks are necessary because all questions are True/False type. Without negative marks, anyone can score roughly half the marks by simply choosing the same option for all questions.</span></p>
    <p><strong>All questions carry equal marks.</strong></p>
    <p>The exam paper has 100 questions.</p>
    <p>Note that you have <strong>slightly more than ½ minute for each question</strong>, which means you need to go through the questions fairly quickly.</p>
    <p>Given the fast pace required by the paper, to be fair to all students, <strong>you will not be allowed to clarify doubts about questions</strong> (in Part 1) by talking to invigilators.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>If a question is not clear, you can choose option C and write your doubt in the exam paper, near the unclear question.</li>
      <li>If your doubt is justified (e.g. there is a typo in the question) or if many students found the question to be unclear, the examiner may decide to omit that question from grading.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Questions in Part 1 are confidential.</strong> You are not allowed to reveal Part 1 content to anyone after the exam. All pages of the assessment paper are to be returned at the end of the exam.</p>
    <p>You will be given OCR forms to indicate your answers for Part 1. As each OCR form can accommodate only 50 answers, you will be given 2 OCR forms. <strong>Indicate your student number in both OCR forms</strong>.</p>
    <p>To save space, we use the following notation in MCQ question.
      <strong>[<ins>x</ins> | y | <ins>z</ins>] means ‘x and z, but not y’</strong></p>
    <tip-box>
      <p>📦 SE is [boring | <ins>useful</ins> | <ins>fun</ins>] means <em>SE is not boring</em> AND <em>SE is useful</em> AND <em>SE is fun</em>.</p>
      <p>📦 Consider the following statement:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>IDEs can help with [<ins>writing</ins> | debugging | <ins>testing</ins>] code.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The correct response for it is <code>False</code> because IDEs can help with all three of the given options, not just writing and testing.</p>
    </tip-box>
    <p>Some questions will use <ins>underlines</ins> or <mark>highlighting</mark> to draw your attention to a specific part of the question. That is because those parts are highly relevant to the answer and we don’t want you to miss the relevance of that
      part.</p>
    <tip-box>
      <p>📦 Consider the statement below:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>Technique ABC <ins>can</ins> be used to generate more test cases.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>The word <ins>can</ins> is underlined because the decision you need to make is whether the ABC <em>can or cannot</em> be used to generate more test cases; the decision is not whether ABC can be used to generate <em>more or better</em> test cases.</p>
    </tip-box>
    <p>Markers such as the one given below appears at left margin of the paper to <strong>indicate where the question corresponds to a new column in the OCR form</strong>. E.g. questions 11, 21, 31, etc. (a column has 10 questions). Such markers can help
      you to detect if you missed a question in the previous 10 questions. You can safely ignore those markers if you are not interested in making use of that additional hint.</p>
    <p><img src="/website-base/admin/images/columnMarker.png"><br></p>
    <p>Some questions have tags e.g., the question below has a tag <strong><code>JAVA</code></strong>. These <strong>tags provide additional context about the question</strong>. In the example below, the tag indicates that the code given in the question
      is Java code.</p>
    <p><img src="/website-base/admin/images/contextTag.png"><br></p>
    <p><strong>The paper is open-book</strong>: you may bring any printed or written materials to the exam in hard copy format. However, given the fast pace required by Part 1, you will not have time left to refer notes during that part of the exam.</p>
    <p>💡 <strong>Mark the OCR form as you go</strong>, rather than planning to transfer your answers to the OCR form near the end. <span class="dimmed"> Reason: Given there are 130+ questions, it will be hard to estimate how much time you need to mass-transfer all answers to OCR forms.</span></p>
    <p>💡 <strong>Write the answer in the exam paper as well</strong> as marking it in the OCR form. <span class="dimmed"> Reason: It will reduce the chance of missing a question. Furthermore, in case you missed a question, it will help you correct the OCR form quickly.</span></p>
    <p>💡 We have tried to <strong>avoid deliberately misleading/tricky questions</strong>. If a question seems to take a very long time to figure out, you are probably over-thinking it.</p>
    <h2 id="final-exam-part-2-essay">Final Exam: Part 2 (Essay)</h2>
    <p>Unlike in part 1, <strong>you can ask invigilators for clarifications</strong> if you found a question to be unclear in part 2.</p>
    <p>Yes, <strong>you may use pencils</strong> when answering part 2.</p>

Given that 30 points matches an effort twice as that needed for the <code>undo/redo</code> feature (which was given as an example of an <code>A</code> grade project), we expect most students to be have efforts
                  lower than 20.</li>
                <li>Count all implementation/testing/documentation work as mentioned in that person's portfolio page.</li>
                <li>❗️ Do not give a high value just <em>to be nice</em>. If your estimate is wildly inaccurate, it means you are unable to estimate the effort required to implement a feature in a project that you are supposed to know well at this point.
                  <mark>You will lose marks if that is the case.</mark></li>

              <ul>
                <li><code>low</code>: One of these
                  <ul>
                    <li>Very small amount of content (i.e., 0.5 - 1 page)</li>

                <li><code>high</code>: Enough diagrams (at lest two kinds of UML diagrams used) and enough descriptions (about 2 pages worth) but explanations are not always easy to follow.</li>
                <li><code>excellent</code>: Easy to follow. Just enough information (not too much). Minimum repetition of content/diagrams. Good use of diagrams to complement text descriptions. Easy to understand diagrams with just enough details rather than

      <p><strong>Bug Review Period</strong>:</p>
      <p>There will be a review period for you to respond to the <a href="https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY1718S2/pe-results/issues">bug reports</a> you received.</p>
      <p>Duration: The review period will start around 1 day after the PE (exact time to be announced) and will last until the following <strong>Wednesday midnight</strong>.</p>
      <p>Bug reviewing is recommended to be done as a team as some of the decisions need team consensus.</p>
      <tip-box>
        <p><strong>Instructions for Reviewing Bug Reports</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p><strong>First, don't freak out if there are lot of bug reports.</strong> Many can be duplicates and some can be <em>false positives</em>. In any case, we anticipate that all of these products will have some bugs and our penalty for bugs is
              not harsh. Furthermore, it depends on the severity of the bug. Some bug may not even be penalized.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p><strong>Do not edit the subject or the description. Do not close bug reports.</strong> Your response (if any) should be added as a comment.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p><strong>If the bug is reported multiple times</strong>, mark all copies EXCEPT one as duplicates using the <code>duplicate</code> tag. In addition, use <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/about-duplicate-issues-and-pull-requests/">this technique</a>              to indicate which issue they are duplicates of. Duplicates can be omitted from processing steps given below.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p><strong>If a bug seems to be for a different product</strong> (i.e. wrongly assigned to your team), let us know (email prof).</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p><strong>Decide if it is a real bug and apply ONLY one of these labels</strong>.</p>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <tip-box>
          <p>Response Labels:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><code>response.Accepted</code> : You accept it as a bug.</li>
            <li><code>response.Rejected</code> : What tester thought as a bug is in fact expected behavior. ❗️ The penalty for rejecting a bug using an unjustifiable explanation is higher than the penalty if the same bug was accepted. You can also reject
              bugs that you inherited from AB4.</li>
            <li><code>response.CannotReproduce</code> : You are unable to reproduce the behavior reported in the bug after multiple tries.</li>
            <li><code>response.IssueUnclear</code> : The issue description is not clear.</li>
          </ul>
        </tip-box>
        <ul>
          <li>If applicable, <strong>decide the type of bug</strong>:</li>
        </ul>
        <tip-box>
          <p>Bug Type Labels:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><code>type-FunctionalityBug</code> : the bug is a flaw in how the product works</li>
            <li><code>type-DocumentationBug</code> : the bug is in the documentation</li>
          </ul>
        </tip-box>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Suggest a severity for the bug</strong>:</li>
        </ul>
        <div>
          <tip-box>
            <p>Bug Severity labels:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><code>severity.Low</code> : A flaw that is unlikely to affect normal operations of the product. Appears only in very rare situations and causes a minor inconvenience only.</li>
              <li><code>severity.Medium</code> : A flaw that causes occasional inconvenience to some users but they can continue to use the product.</li>
              <li><code>severity.High</code> : A flaw that affects most users and causes major problems for users. i.e., makes the product almost unusable for most users.</li>
            </ul>
          </tip-box>
        </div>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p><strong>Decide who should fix the bug</strong>. Use the <code>Assignees</code> field to assign the issue to that person(s). There is no need to actually fix the bug though. It's simply an indication/acceptance of responsibility. <strong>If there is no assignee and we are unable to determine a suitable assignee ourselves, we'll have no choice but to distribute the penalty for that bug (if any) among all team members.</strong></p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p><strong>Add an explanatory comment</strong> explaining your choice of labels and assignees.</p>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </tip-box>
      <p><strong>Grading:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Your performance in the practical exam will be considered for your final grade (under the <em>QA</em> category and under <em>Implementation</em> category, about 10 marks in total).</li>
        <li>You will be graded based on many bugs in the product you tested and how far off your evaluation/estimates are from the evaluator consensus. <span class="dimmed"> Explanation: we understand that you have limited expertise in this area; hence, we penalize only if your inputs don't seem be be based on a sincere effort to test/evaluate.</span></li>
        <li>The bugs found in your product by others will affect your v1.5 marks. You will be given a chance to reject false-positive bug reports.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
  </panel>
  <panel type="seamless" header="Expectations for writing automated tests:" expanded="">
    <div>
      <ul>
        <li>There is no requirement for a minimum coverage level. Note that in a production environment you are often required to have at least 90% of the code covered by tests. In this project, it can be less. The less coverage you have, the higher the risk
          of regression bugs, which will cost marks if not fixed before the final submission.</li>
        <li>You <mark>must write <em>some</em> tests</mark> so that we can evaluate your ability to write tests.</li>
        <li>How much of each type of testing should you do? We expect you to decide. You learned different types of testing and what they try to achieve. Based on that, you should decide how much of each type is required. Similarly, you can decide to what
          extent you want to automate tests, depending on the benefits and the effort required.</li>
        <li>Applying TDD is optional. If you plan to test something, it is better to apply TDD because TDD ensures that you write functional code in a testable way. If you do it the normal way, you often find that it is hard to test the functional code because
          the code has low testability.</li>
