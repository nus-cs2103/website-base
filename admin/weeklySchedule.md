### {{ module_pair }} week vs normal academic week

**Each {{ module_pair }} week starts with the lecture** and ends just before the following week's lecture. The only exception is week 1, which starts on the Monday of the first week of the semester. <div tags="m--cs2103 m--cs2113 m--tic4001 m--tic4002">As our lecture is on {{ day_lecture }}, =={{ module_pair }} week starts a few days earlier than the normal NUS academic week==. For example, {{ module_pair }} week 2 starts on the {{ day_lecture }} of NUS week 1. See the [full timeline](../schedule/timeline.html) for exact dates.</div>

### Deadline for weekly tasks

<div tags="m--cs2103 m--cs2113">

**The soft deadline to complete tasks allocated to a week** is the <tooltip content="e.g., if your tutorial is on Thursday, the deadline is Wednesday 23.59">midnight before your tutorial day</tooltip>, unless a specific deadline is given. You are strongly encouraged to finish most weekly tasks before the soft deadline because some tutorial tasks are done best _after_ weekly tasks have been completed, for the best learning experience.

<span class="text-danger">**The hard deadline** for weekly tasks is the following lecture</span> i.e., do this week's task before the next week's lecture.

<!--
**We are not strict with most interim weekly project deadlines** i.e., we'll not penalize you even if you occasionally miss those deadlines, as long as you catch up soon enough (within a few days after the hard deadline).
-->

**It's OK to make occasional mistakes in weekly tasks** (making mistakes is a natural part of learning new things after all). If a weekly task was not accepted as 'done' due to a mistake you made, go ahead and rectify the mistake as soon as you can -- our grading scripts will not penalize such mistakes if they are corrected soon after.

 * Use the relevant learning resources to learn the topics.
 * Self-test your knowledge using exercises given in the learning resources. 
 * ==Submit the post-lecture quiz/exercises== (if any)
 * ==Do project tasks== %%(e.g., attend weekly project meeting, finish weekly deliverables)%%
