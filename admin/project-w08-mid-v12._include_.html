              <li>
                <p>Automated tests have benefits, but they can be a pain to write/maintain; GUI tests are especially hard to maintain because their behavior can sometimes depend on things such as the OS, resolution etc.</p>
                <p>It is OK to get rid of some of the troublesome tests and rely more on manual testing instead. The less automated test coverage you have, the higher the risk of regressions; but it may be an acceptable trade-off under the circumstances
                  if tests are slowing you down too much. There is no direct penalty for removing GUI tests.</p>
                <p>Also note

            <ul>
              <li>There is no requirement for a minimum coverage level. Note that in a production environment you are often required to have at least 90% of the code covered by tests. In this project, it can be less. The less coverage you have, the higher
                the risk of regression bugs, which will cost marks if not fixed before the final submission.</li>
              <li>You <mark>must write <em>some</em> tests</mark> so that we can evaluate your ability to write tests.</li>
              <li>How much of each type of testing should you do? We expect you to decide. You learned different types of testing and what they try to achieve. Based on that, you should decide how much of each type is required. Similarly, you can decide to
                what extent you want to automate tests, depending on the benefits and the effort required.</li>
              <li>Applying TDD is optional. If you plan to test something, it is better to apply TDD because TDD ensures that you write functional code in a testable way. If you do it the normal way, you often find that it is hard to test the functional code
                because the code has low testability.</li>

            <h2 id="project-schedule-tracking">Project Schedule Tracking</h2>
            <p>In general, use the issue tracker (Milestones, Issues, PRs, Tags, Releases, and Labels) for assigning, scheduling, and tracking <em>all</em> noteworthy project tasks, including user stories. Update the issue tracker regularly to reflect the
              current status of the project. You can also use GitHub's new <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6MGKHkNtxU">Projects feature</a> to manage the project, but keep it linked to the issue tracker as much as you can.</p>
            <h3 id="using-issues">Using Issues:</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <p><strong>Record each of the user stories you plan to deliver as an issue in the issue tracker.</strong>
                  <span class="dimmed">e.g.</span> <code>Title: As a user I can add a deadline</code><br>
                  <code>Description: ... so that I can keep track of my deadlines</code></p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p><strong>Assign the <code>type.*</code> and <code>priority.*</code> labels to those issues.</strong></p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p><strong>When you start implementing a story, break it down to tasks.</strong> Define reasonable sized, standalone tasks. A task should be able to done by one person, in a few hours. <span class="dimmed">e.g.</span></p>
                <ul>
                  <li><span class="dimmed">👍 Good: Update class diagram in the project manual for v1.4</span></li>
                  <li><span class="dimmed">👎 Bad (reasons: not a one-person task, not small enough): Write the project manual</span></li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p><strong>Write a descriptive title for the issue.</strong> <span class="dimmed">e.g. Add support for the 'undo' command to the parser.</span></p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p><strong>There is no need to break things into VERY small tasks.</strong> Keep them as big as possible, but they should be no bigger than what you are going to assign a single person to do within a week. <span class="dimmed">eg.,</span></p>
                <ul>
                  <li><code>Implementing parser</code>  <span class="dimmed">: too big because it cannot be done by a single person in a week.</span></li>
                  <li><code>Implementing parser support for adding of floating tasks</code> <span class="dimmed">: appropriate size.</span></li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p><strong>Do not track things taken for granted.</strong> <span class="dimmed">e.g., <code>push code to repo</code> should not be a task to track. In the example given under the previous point, it is taken for granted that the owner will also (a) test the code and (b) push to the repo when it is ready. Those two need not be tracked as separate tasks.</span></p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p><strong>Omit redundant details.</strong> In some cases, the summary/title is enough to describe the task. In that case, no need to repeat it in the description. There is no need for well-crafted and detailed descriptions for tasks. A minimal
                  description is enough. Similarly, labels such as <code>priority</code> can be omitted if you think they don't help you.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p><strong>Assign tasks to team members using the <code>assignees</code> field.</strong> At any point, there should be some ongoing tasks and some pending tasks against each team member.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p><strong>Optionally, you can use <code>status.ongoing</code> label to indicate issues currently ongoing.</strong></p>
              </li>
            </ul>

              <ul>
                <li>
                  <p>Use <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/about-milestones/">GitHub milestones</a> to indicate which issues are to be handled for which milestone by assigning issues to suitable milestones.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>Set the deadlines for milestones (in GitHub). Your internal milestones can be set earlier than the deadlines we have set, to give you a buffer.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>Note that you can change the milestone plan along the way as necessary.</p>

              <p><strong>Wrapping up a Milestone</strong>:<br>
                <mark>Here are the conditions to satisfy for a milestone to be considered properly wrapped up</mark>:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <p>A working product tagged with the correct tag (e.g. v1.2) is pushed to the main repo.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>All tests passing on Travis for the version tagged above.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>Milestone updated to match the product i.e. all issues completed and PRs merged for the milestone should be assigned to the milestone.<br>
                    <img src="/website-base/admin/images/assigningIssuesToMilestones.png" width="700"></p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>Milestone closed. If there are incomplete issues or unmerged PRs in the milestone, move them to a future milestone.<br>

                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>Optionally, issues for the next milestone are assigned to team members (this is not compulsory to do <em>before</em> the tutorial, but we recommend you to do it soon after the tutorial).</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>Optionally, future milestones are revised based on what you experienced in the current milestone <span class="dimmed"> e.g. if you could not finish all issues assigned to the current milestone, it is a sign that you overestimated how much you can do in a week, which means you might want to reduce the issues assigned to future milestones to match that observation</span>.</p>

                <li>
                  <p>Doing a 'release' on GitHub is optional for v1.1 and v1.2 but compulsory from v1.3.</p>
