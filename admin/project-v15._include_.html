<h3 id="v15-demo">v1.5 Demo</h3>
<img src="/website/admin/images/v05demo.png" style="width: 250px">
<ul>
  <li><strong>Venue:</strong> Same as the tutorial venue.</li>
  <li><strong>Duration:</strong> Strictly no more than 3 minutes per person (i.e. a total of 12 minutes for a 4-person team). Exceeding this limit will be penalized.</li>
  <li><strong>Schedule:</strong> Your demo timing is same as your tutorial time in week 13.<br> Starting times: <code>Team B1: 00 minutes, B2: 15 minutes, B3: 30 minutes, B4: 45 minutes</code><br> At least some team members need to arrive 15 minutes ahead
    of the allocated time to set up your computer.<br> There is an <mark>automatic penalty if you are not ready to start on time.</mark>.</li>
  <li><strong>Target audience</strong>: Assume you are giving a demo to a higher-level manager of your company, to brief him/her on the current capabilities of the product.</li>
  <li><strong>Scope</strong>:
    <ul>
      <li>Organize the demo to present a cohesive picture of the product as a whole. Unlike in v1.4-v1.5rc demos, there is no need for each person to demo their own features.</li>
      <li>Remember to explain the profile of the target user early in the demo.</li>
      <li>The scenarios you demonstrate should be chosen judiciously so that you cover the full range of your product's functionality. Give more time to stronger features (i.e. cover mundane/basic features fast). It is recommended you showcase how the product
        improves the user’s life rather than simply describe each feature.</li>
      <li>No need to cover design/implementation details as the manager is not interested in those details.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Dress code</strong> : The level of formality is up to you, but it is recommended that the whole team dress at the same level.</li>
  <li><strong>Testing:</strong> All team member should remain in the holding area during the tutorial slot (when you are not doing the demo) because our testers might need to communicate with you during the testing.<br> Holding area for Active Learning Room:
    Unused area of the room (enter by the door near the staircase)<br> Holding area for SR5 and SR10: corridor outside the venue</li>
  <li><strong>Structure:</strong><br> Demo the product using the same executable you submitted, on your own laptop, using the TV.<br> Every team member should take part in the demo. However, it's ok for one member to do all the typing.</li>
  <li><strong>Optimizing the time:</strong><br> Try to make the maximum use of the short demo time in the following ways,
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>Spend as much time as possible on demonstrating the actual product. Not recommended to use slides (if you do, use them sparingly) or videos or lengthy narrations.<br> Avoid skits, re-enactments, dramatizations etc. This is not a sales pitch or
          an informercial. While you need to show how a user use the product to get value, but you don’t need to act like an imaginary user. For example, [Instead of this]<code>Jim get’s a call from boss. &quot;Ring ring&quot;, &quot;hello&quot;, &quot;oh hi Jim, can we postpone the meeting?&quot; &quot;Sure&quot;. Jim hang up and curses the boss under his breath. Now he starts typing ..etc.</code><br>          [do this] <code>If Jim needs to postpone the meeting, he can type …</code><br> It’s not that dramatization is bad or we don’t like it. We simply don’t have enough time for it.<br> Note that CS2101 demo requirements may differ. Different context
          → Different requirements.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Rehearse the steps well and ensure you can do a smooth demo. <mark>Demos that are clearly under-prepared will be penalized.</mark></p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Don’t waste time repeating things the target audience already knows. e.g. no need to say things like &quot;We are students from NUS, SoC&quot;.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Bring sufficient amount of sample data and know how to load them to the system. You should not plan to type all the sample data during the demo itself. On the other hand, trying to demo a product using just a couple of sample tasks creates a bad
          impression too.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Plan the demo to be in sync with the impression you want to create. For example, if you are trying to convince that the product is easy to use, show the easiest way to perform a task before you show the full command with all the bells and whistles.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
