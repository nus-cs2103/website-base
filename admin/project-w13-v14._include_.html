          <li>
            <p><strong>Duration:</strong> Strictly <code>(teamSize x 3) + 1</code> minutes <span class="dimmed"> e.g. 17 minutes for a 5-person team.</span> Exceeding this limit will be penalized. The extra minute is for the first speaker to give an overview
              of the product.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p><strong>Target audience</strong>: Assume you are giving a demo to a higher-level manager of your company, to brief him/her on the current capabilities of the product. This is the first time they are seeing the new product you developed but
              they are familiar with the AddressBook-level4 (AB4) product.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p><strong>Scope</strong>:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Each person should demo the enhancements they added</strong>. However, it's ok for one member to do all the typing.</li>
              <li>Subjected to the constraint mentioned in the previous point, as far as possible, organize the demo to present a cohesive picture of the product as a whole, presented in a logical order. <span class="dimmed"> Remember to explain the profile of the target user profile and value proposition early in the demo.</span></li>
              <li>It is recommended you showcase how the feature improves the user’s life rather than simply describe each feature.</li>
              <li>No need to cover design/implementation details as the manager is not interested in those details.</li>
              <li>Mention features you inherited from AB4 only if they are needed to explain your new features. <span class="dimmed"> Reason: existing features will not earn you marks, and the audience is already familiar with AB4 features.</span></li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p><strong>Structure:</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>Demo the product using the same executable you submitted, on your own laptop, using the TV.</li>
              <li>It can be <strong>a <em>sitting down</em> demo</strong>: You'll be demonstrating the features using the TV while sitting down. But you may stand around the TV if you prefer that way.</li>
              <li>It will be uninterrupted demo: The audience members will not interrupt you during the demo. That means you should finish within the given time.</li>
              <li>The app should be populated with a significant amount of realistic data at the start. <span class="dimmed"> e.g at least 20 contacts</span>.</li>
              <li><strong>Dress code</strong> : The level of formality is up to you, but it is recommended that the whole team dress at the same level.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p><strong>Optimizing the time:</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>Spend as much time as possible on demonstrating the actual product. Not recommended to use slides (if you do, use them sparingly) or videos or lengthy narrations.<br> Avoid skits, re-enactments, dramatizations etc. This is not a sales pitch
                or an informercial. While you need to show how a user use the product to get value, but you don’t need to act like an imaginary user. For example, [Instead of this]<code>Jim get’s a call from boss. &quot;Ring ring&quot;, &quot;hello&quot;, &quot;oh hi Jim, can we postpone the meeting?&quot; &quot;Sure&quot;. Jim hang up and curses the boss under his breath. Now he starts typing ..etc.</code>                [do this] <code>If Jim needs to postpone the meeting, he can type …</code><br> It’s not that dramatization is bad or we don’t like it. We simply don’t have enough time for it.<br> Note that CS2101 demo requirements may differ. Different
                context → Different requirements.</li>
              <li>Rehearse the steps well and ensure you can do a smooth demo. Poor quality demos can affect your grade.</li>
              <li>Don’t waste time repeating things the target audience already knows. e.g. no need to say things like &quot;We are students from NUS, SoC&quot;.</li>
              <li>Bring sufficient amount of sample data and know how to load them to the system. You should not plan to type all the sample data during the demo itself. On the other hand, trying to demo a product using just 1-2 sample data creates a bad
                impression too.</li>
              <li>Plan the demo to be in sync with the impression you want to create. For example, if you are trying to convince that the product is easy to use, show the easiest way to perform a task before you show the full command with all the bells and
                whistles.</li>
              <li>Limit the demo to CLI inputs only. There is no point explaining GUI inputs because they don't earn marks.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>
    </panel>
    <p></p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Venue:</strong> Same as the tutorial venue unless informed otherwise.</li>
      <li><strong>Schedule:</strong> Your demo timing is same as your tutorial time in week 13.<br> Starting times: <code>Team B1: 00 minutes, B2: 20 minutes, B3: 40 minutes, B4: TBA</code><br> At least some team members need to arrive 15 minutes ahead of
        the allocated time to set up your computer.<br> There is an <mark>automatic penalty if you are not ready to start on time.</mark><br> Wait outside the venue until you are called in.</li>

          <p><strong>Preparation</strong>:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Ensure you have access to a <strong>computer that is able to run module projects</strong> <span class="dimmed"> e.g. has the right Java version</span>.</li>
            <li><strong>Have a good screen grab tool</strong> with annotation features so that you can quickly take a screenshot of a bug, annotate it, and post in the issue tracker.</li>
            <li>💡 You can use <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>V</kbd> to paste a picture from the clipboard into a text box in GitHub issue tracker.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <p><strong>During:</strong></p>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Take note of your team to test and your <em>Tester ID</em></strong>. Both will be given to you by the teaching team (distributed via IVLE gradebook).</li>
          <li><strong>Download from IVLE all files</strong> submitted by the team <span class="dimmed"> (i.e. jar file, User Guide, Developer Guide, and Project Portfolio Pages)</span> <mark>into an empty folder</mark>.</li>
          <li><strong>[~40 minutes] Test the product and report bugs</strong>
            <ul>
              <li>Launch the jar file. Test it.</li>
              <li>You can use Developer Guide (Appendix named <em>Instructions for Manual Testing</em>) and the User Guide in your testing.</li>
              <li>No need to test features that are driven by GUI inputs (e.g. buttons, menus, etc.) <span class="dimmed"> Reason: Only CLI-driven features can earn credit, as per given project constraints.</span> Some features might have both a GUI-driven
                and CLI-driven ways to invoke them, in which case test only the CLI-driven way of invoking it.</li>
              <li>The testing instructions in the Developer Guide can provide you some guidance but if you follow those instructions strictly, you are unlikely to find many bugs. You can deviate from the instructions to probe areas that are more likely to
                have bugs.</li>
              <li>You can do <em>acceptance</em> testing as well as <em>system</em> testing.</li>
              <li>Omit feature that existed in AB4. Instead, test features added by the team.</li>
              <li>Report bugs in the <a href="https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY1718S2/pe/issues">practical exam issue tracker</a>, <mark>not in the team's repo</mark>.
                <ul>
                  <li>Issue title format: <code>[Tester ID] Issue description</code> <span class="dimmed"> e.g. <code>[26] Empty name crashes app</code></span></li>
                  <li>Do not use team ID in bug reports <span class="dimmed"> Reason: to prevent others copying your bug reports</span></li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>Report bugs only. Do not post suggestions. These are considered bugs:
                <ul>
                  <li>Behavior differs from the User Guide (or Developer Guide)</li>
                  <li>A legitimate user behavior is not handled <span class="dimmed"> e.g. incorrect commands, extra parameters</span></li>
                  <li>Behavior is not specified and differs from normal expectations <span class="dimmed"> e.g. error message does not match the error</span></li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>Write good quality bug reports; ❗️ <strong>poor quality or incorrect bug reports will not earn credit</strong>.
                <ul>
                  <li>Use a descriptive title</li>
                  <li>Give a good description of the bug with steps to reproduce and screenshots</li>
                  <li><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-eye-close" aria-hidden="true"></span> Note that we will <strong>anonymize bug reports</strong> before revealing it to the receiving team.</li>

                <p><strong>A. Cohesiveness of product features</strong> [👥]: Do the features fit together and match the stated target user and the value proposition?</p>
                <ul>
                  <li><code>low</code>: One of these
                    <ul>
                      <li>target user is too general <span class="dimmed"> i.e. not narrower than AB4</span></li>
                      <li>target user and value proposition is not clear from the user guide OR</li>

                  </li>
                  <li><code>medium</code>: Some features match but some don't</li>
                  <li><code>high</code>: all features match but the features are not very high value to the target user</li>
                  <li><code>excellent</code>: the product is very attractive to the target user. i.e. and almost all new features are of high-value to the target user.</li>
                  <li><code>unable to judge</code>: you are unable to judge this aspect for some reason</li>
                </ul>

              <li>
                <p><strong>B. Quality of user docs</strong> [👤]: Evaluate based on the parts of the user guide written by the person, as reproduced in the project portfolio. <mark>Evaluate from an end-user perspective.</mark></p>
                <ul>
                  <li><code>low</code>: Hard to understand, often inaccurate or missing important information</li>
                  <li><code>medium</code>:</li>
                  <li><code>high</code>: Mostly easy to follow. Only a few areas for improvements.</li>
                  <li><code>excellent</code>: Easy to follow and accurate. Just enough information, visuals, examples etc. (not too much either).</li>
                  <li><code>unable to judge</code>: less than 1 page worth of UG content written by the student</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p><strong>C. Amount of work</strong> [👤]: Evaluate the amount of work on a scale of 0 to 30</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Consider <a href="https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/pull/440/files">this PR (<code>history</code> command)</a> as 5 units of effort which means <a href="https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/pull/610/files">this PR (<code>undo/redo</code> command)</a>                    is about 15 points of effort. Given that 30 points matches an effort twice as that needed for the <code>undo/redo</code> feature (which was given as an example of an <code>A</code> grade project), we expect most students to be have
                    efforts lower than 20.</li>
                  <li>Count all implementation/testing/documentation work as mentioned in that person's portfolio page.</li>
                  <li>❗️ Do not give a high value just <em>to be nice</em>. If your estimate is wildly inaccurate, it means you are unable to estimate the effort required to implement a feature in a project that you are supposed to know well at this point.
                    <mark>You will lose marks if that is the case.</mark></li>
                  <li>When estimating effort, ignore features that are driven by GUI inputs.</li>

Note: examples given below assumes AB4 did not have commands<code>edit</code>                  <code>undo</code> <code>redo</code></p>
                <ul>

                  <li><code>medium</code> : moderately difficult feature, barely acceptable implementation <span class="dimmed"> e.g. an <em>edit</em> command that requires the user to type <em>all</em> fields, even the ones that are not being edited</span></li>
                  <li><code>high</code>: one of the below
                    <ul>
                      <li>A moderately difficult feature but fully implemented <span class="dimmed"> e.g. an <em>edit</em> command that allows editing any field</span></li>
                      <li>A difficult feature with a reasonable implementation but some aspects are not covered <span class="dimmed"> undo/redo command that only allows a single undo/redo</span></li>
                    </ul>
                  </li>
                  <li><code>excellent</code>: A difficult feature, all reasonable aspects are fully implemented <span class="dimmed"> undo/redo command that allows multiple undo/redo</span></li>
                  <li><code>outstanding</code>: A difficult feature, implemented as good as it can be under the circumstances. <span class="dimmed"> undo/redo command that even allows undoing non-mutating commands such as <em>select</em>, allows selectively undo specific commands in the history, etc.</span></li>

                <p><strong>E. Quality of developer docs</strong> [👤]: Evaluate based on the developer docs cited/reproduced in the respective project portfolio page. <mark>Evaluate from the perspective of a new developer trying to understand how the features are implemented.</mark></p>
                <ul>
                  <li><code>low</code>: One of these
                    <ul>
                      <li>Very small amount of content (i.e., 0.5 - 1 page)</li>
                      <li>Hardly any use to the reader (i.e., content doesn't make much sense or redundant)</li>

                  <li><code>high</code>: Enough diagrams (at lest two kinds of UML diagrams used) and enough descriptions (about 2 pages worth) but explanations are not always easy to follow.</li>
                  <li><code>excellent</code>: Easy to follow. Just enough information (not too much). Minimum repetition of content/diagrams. Good use of diagrams to complement text descriptions. Easy to understand diagrams with just enough details rather

        <p><strong>Bug Review Period</strong>:</p>
        <p>There will be a review period for you to respond to the <a href="https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY1718S2/pe-results/issues">bug reports</a> you received.</p>
        <p>Duration: The review period will start around 1 day after the PE (exact time to be announced) and will last until the following <strong>Wednesday midnight</strong>.</p>
        <p>Bug reviewing is recommended to be done as a team as some of the decisions need team consensus.</p>
        <tip-box>
          <p><strong>Instructions for Reviewing Bug Reports</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p><strong>First, don't freak out if there are lot of bug reports.</strong> Many can be duplicates and some can be <em>false positives</em>. In any case, we anticipate that all of these products will have some bugs and our penalty for bugs
                is not harsh. Furthermore, it depends on the severity of the bug. Some bug may not even be penalized.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p><strong>Do not edit the subject or the description. Do not close bug reports.</strong> Your response (if any) should be added as a comment.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p><strong>If the bug is reported multiple times</strong>, mark all copies EXCEPT one as duplicates using the <code>duplicate</code> tag. In addition, use <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/about-duplicate-issues-and-pull-requests/">this technique</a>                to indicate which issue they are duplicates of. Duplicates can be omitted from processing steps given below.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p><strong>If a bug seems to be for a different product</strong> (i.e. wrongly assigned to your team), let us know (email prof).</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p><strong>Decide if it is a real bug and apply ONLY one of these labels</strong>.</p>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <tip-box>
            <p>Response Labels:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><code>response.Accepted</code> : You accept it as a bug.</li>
              <li><code>response.Rejected</code> : What tester thought as a bug is in fact expected behavior. ❗️ The penalty for rejecting a bug using an unjustifiable explanation is higher than the penalty if the same bug was accepted. You can also reject
                bugs that you inherited from AB4.</li>
              <li><code>response.CannotReproduce</code> : You are unable to reproduce the behavior reported in the bug after multiple tries.</li>
              <li><code>response.IssueUnclear</code> : The issue description is not clear.</li>
            </ul>
          </tip-box>
          <ul>
            <li>If applicable, <strong>decide the type of bug</strong>:</li>
          </ul>
          <tip-box>
            <p>Bug Type Labels:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><code>type-FunctionalityBug</code> : the bug is a flaw in how the product works</li>
              <li><code>type-DocumentationBug</code> : the bug is in the documentation</li>
            </ul>

              </ul>
            </tip-box>
          </div>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p><strong>Decide who should fix the bug</strong>. Use the <code>Assignees</code> field to assign the issue to that person(s). There is no need to actually fix the bug though. It's simply an indication/acceptance of responsibility. <strong>If there is no assignee and we are unable to determine a suitable assignee ourselves, we'll have no choice but to distribute the penalty for that bug (if any) among all team members.</strong></p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p><strong>Add an explanatory comment</strong> explaining your choice of labels and assignees.</p>
