* Ensure that you have accepted the invitation to join the GitHub org used by the module. Go to [{{ url_module_org }}]({{ url_module_org }}) to accept the invitation.

* Ensure you have access to a **computer that is able to run module projects** %%e.g. has the right Java version%%.

* **Download the [latest CATcher](https://github.com/CATcher-org/CATcher/releases)** and ensure you can run it on your computer. You should have done this when you smoke-tested CATcher earlier in the week.

Issues created for PE-D and PE need to be in a precise format for our grading scripts to work. Incorrectly-formatted responses will have to discarded. Therefore, you are **<span class="text-danger">not allowed to use the GitHub interface for PE-D and PE activities, unless you have obtained  our permission first</span>**.

* Create a public repo in your GitHub account with the following name:
  * PE Dry Run: `ped`
  * PE: `pe`
* Enable its issue tracker and add the following labels to it (the label names should be precisely as given).

<include src="appendixE-gitHub.md#bug-severity" />
<include src="tp-pe.mbdf#type-labels" />

</panel><p/>
</div>

* **Have a good screen grab tool** with annotation features so that you can quickly take a screenshot of a bug, annotate it, and post in the issue tracker.<br>
  {{ icon_tip }} You can use <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>V</kbd> to paste a picture from the clipboard into a text box in a bug report.

* **[Optional] Have a good screen recording tool** if you plan to use screen recording clips as part of your bug reports. Ensure that your screen recording tool can create small files as CATcher doesn't allow files bigger than 10Mb.<br>
  {{ icon_important }} As the CATcher support for uploading screen recordings is new and limited, use it only if strictly necessary -- use screenshots for other cases.

* **<span class="text-danger">Download the product to be tested</span>**.

****Testing tips****{.text-success}

{% set tip %}<span class="text-success">**:fas-lightbulb:**</span>{% endset %}

{{ tip }} **Use easy-to-remember patterns in test data.** For example, if you use `12345678` as a phone number while testing and it appears as `2345678` somewhere else in the UI, you can easily spot that the first digit has gone missing. But if you used a random number instead, detecting that bug won't be as easy. Similarly, if you use `Alice Bee`, `Benny Lee`, `Charles Pereira` as test data (note how the names start with letters A, B, C), it will be easy to detect if one goes missing, or they appear in the incorrect order.

{{ tip }} **Go wide before you go deep**. Do a light testing of all features first. That will give you a better idea of which features are likely to be more buggy. Spending equal time for all features or testing in the order the features appear in the UG is not always the best approach.
