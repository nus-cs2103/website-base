**This course is supported by a customized online textbook** [**_Software Engineering for Self-Directed Learners_** ({{ course }} edition)]({{ baseUrl }}/se-book-adapted/index.html), integrated into this course website.

**Topics relevant for a week appears under the weekly schedule page** (see the <span class="text-primary">{{ show_as_tab('Topics', icon_tab_topics) }}</span> tab). Some topics in there come with pre-recorded videos. ==Watching those videos is encouraged but optional==: while they do not have additional theory not already covered by the text version, they can have complementary explanations, more examples, visualizations etc.

##### Tips for watching pre-recorded videos

* ==You are recommended to watch the videos provided at faster speeds== (`x1.25` or even `x1.5`) to save time.{% if cs2113 %}
* The pre-recorded videos and lecture webcasts are distributed via Canvas.{% else %}
* You'll need to use your NUSNET login to access them.{% endif %}

==**A PDF version of the full textbook will be provided**== at the start of the semester, via Canvas. In addition, you can [use this technique](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/savingPdf.html) to save the main text of a specific page/chapter as a pdf file.
