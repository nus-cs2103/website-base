      In general, each team is expected to take one of these two directions:
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p><strong>[Direction 1]  <em>Optimize</em></strong> AddressBook for a more specific target user group:</p>
          <panel header="%%<span class='glyphicon glyphicon-gift' aria-hidden='true'></span> Examples for the _optimize_ direction%%" minimized="">
            <p>An AddressBook,</p>
            <ul>
              <li>for users in a specific profession <span class="dimmed"> e.g. doctors, salesmen, teachers, etc.</span></li>
              <li>based on the nature/scale of contacts <span class="dimmed"> e.g. huge number of contacts (for HR admins, user group admins), mostly incomplete contacts, highly volatile contact details, contacts become inactive after a specific period (e.g. contract employees)</span></li>
              <li>based on what users do with the contacts <span class="dimmed"> e.g. organize group events, share info, do business, do analytics</span></li>
            </ul>
            <p></p>
          </panel>
          <p></p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><strong>[Direction 2] <em>Morph</em></strong> AddressBook into a different product: Given that AddressBook is a generic app that manages a type of elements (i.e. contacts), you can use it as a starting point to create an app that manages something
            else.<br> ❗️ This is a high-risk high-reward option because morphing requires extra work but a morphed product may earn more marks than an optimized product of similar complexity.</p>
          <panel header="%%<span class='glyphicon glyphicon-gift' aria-hidden='true'></span> Examples for the _morph_ direction%%" minimized="">
            <p>An app to manage,</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Bookmarks of websites</li>
              <li>Tasks/Schedule</li>
              <li>Location info</li>
              <li>Thing to memorize i.e. flash cards, trivia</li>
              <li>Forum posts, news feeds, Social media feeds</li>
              <li>Online projects or issue trackers that the user is interested in</li>
              <li>Emails, possibly from different accounts</li>
              <li>Multiple types of related things <span class="dimmed"> e.g. Contacts and Tasks (if Tasks are allocated to Contacts)</span></li>

          </panel>
          <p></p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>For either direction, you need to define a target user profile and a value proposition:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Target user profile</strong>: Define a very specific target user profile. <br> 💡 We require you narrow down the target user profile <span class="dimmed"> as opposed to trying to make it as general as possible. Here is an example direction of narrowing down target user: anybody → teachers → university teachers → tech savvy university teachers → CS2103 instructors.</span><br><br>          ❗️ Be careful not to contradict given project constraints when defining the user profile <span class="dimmed"> e.g. the target user should still prefer typing over mouse actions</span>.<br><br>
          <strong>It is expected that your product will be optimized for the chosen target users</strong> <span class="dimmed">i.e., add features that are especially/only applicable for target users (to make the app especially attractive to them). w.r.t. the example above, there can be features that are applicable to CS2103 instructors only, such as the ability to navigate to a student's project on GitHub</span>          💡 Your project will be graded based on how well the features match the target user profile and how well the features fit-together.</li>
      </ul>
      <div class="indented-level2">
        <panel header="%%Why the need to narrow down the user profile?%%" minimized="">
          <ul>
            <li>It is an opportunity to exercise your product design skills because optimizing the product to a very specific target user requires good product design skills.</li>
            <li>It minimizes the overlap between features of different teams which can cause plagiarism issues. Furthermore, higher the number of other teams having the same features, less impressive your work becomes especially if others have done a better
              job of implementing that feature.</li>

      </div>

        <li><strong>Value proposition</strong>: Define a clear <em>value proposition</em> <span class="dimmed">(what problem does the product solve? how does it make the the user's life easier?)</span> that matches the target user profile.</li>

      <p>Here is a non-exhaustive list of minor enhancements:</p>

      <p><strong>Recommended: contribute to all aspects of the project</strong>: e.g. write backend code, frontend code, test code, user documentation, and developer documentation. If you limit yourself to certain aspects only, you will lose marks allocated
        for the aspects you did not do.<br> In particular, <mark>you are required to divide work based on features rather than components</mark>:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>By the end of this project (i.e. by v1.4) each team member is expected to have implemented an enhancement/feature end-to-end, doing required changes in <em>almost all</em> components. <span class="dimmed"> Reason: to encourage you to learn all components of the software, instead of limiting yourself to just one/few components</span>.</li>
        <li>Nevertheless, you are <mark>still expected to divide the components of the product among team members</mark> so that each team member is <em>in charge</em> of one or more components. While others will be modifying those components as necessary
          for the features they are implementing, your role as the <em>in charge</em> of a component is to guide others modifying that component <span class="dimmed"> (reason: you are supposed to be the most knowledgeable about that component)</span>          and protect that component from degrading <span class="dimmed"> e.g., you can review others' changes to your component and suggest possible changes</span>.</li>
      </ul>

    <li>
      <p><strong>Do a share of team-tasks</strong>: These are the tasks that <em>someone</em> in the team has to do. Marks allocated to team-tasks will be divided among team members based on how much each member contributed to those tasks.</p>
