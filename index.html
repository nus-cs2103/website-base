                          <p>The following description of the <em>Joys of the Programming Craft</em> was taken from Chapter 1 of the famous book
                            <trigger for="modal:mmm" trigger="click"><em>The Mythical Man-Month</em>, by Frederick P. Brooks</trigger>.</p>
                          <blockquote>
                            <p><strong>Why is programming fun? What delights may its practitioner expect as his reward?</strong></p>
                            <p>First is the sheer joy of making things. As the child delights in his mud pie, so the adult enjoys building things, especially things of his own design. I think this delight must be an image of God's delight in making things,
                              a delight shown in the distinctness and newness of each leaf and each snowflake.</p>
                            <p>Second is the pleasure of making things that are useful to other people. Deep within, we want others to use our work and to find it helpful. In this respect the programming system is not essentially different from the child's
                              first clay pencil holder &quot;for Daddy's office.&quot;</p>
                            <p>Third is the fascination of fashioning complex puzzle-like objects of interlocking moving parts and watching them work in subtle cycles, playing out the consequences of principles built in from the beginning. The programmed
                              computer has all the fascination of the pinball machine or the jukebox mechanism, carried to the ultimate.</p>
                            <p>Fourth is the joy of always learning, which springs from the nonrepeating nature of the task. In one way or another the problem is ever new, and its solver learns something: sometimes practical, sometimes theoretical, and sometimes
                              both.</p>
                            <p>Finally, there is the delight of working in such a tractable medium. The programmer, like the poet, works only slightly removed from pure thought-stuff. He builds his castles in the air, from air, creating by the exertion of
                              the imagination. Few media of creation are so flexible, so easy to polish and rework, so readily capable of realizing grand conceptual structures....</p>
                            <p>Yet the program construct, unlike the poet's words, is real in the sense that it moves and works, producing visible outputs separate from the construct itself. It prints results, draws pictures, produces sounds, moves arms.
                              The magic of myth and legend has come true in our time. One types the correct incantation on a keyboard, and a display screen comes to life, showing things that never were nor could be.</p>
                            <p>Programming then is fun because it gratifies creative longings built deep within us and delights sensibilities we have in common with all men.</p>
                          </blockquote>
                          <blockquote>
                            <p><strong>Not all is delight, however, and knowing the inherent woes makes it easier to bear them when they appear.</strong></p>
                            <p>First, one must perform perfectly. The computer resembles the magic of legend in this respect, too. If one character, one pause, of the incantation is not strictly in proper form, the magic doesn't work. Human beings are not
                              accustomed to being perfect, and few areas of human activity demand it. Adjusting to the requirement for perfection is, I think, the most difficult part of learning to program.</p>
                            <p>Next, other people set one's objectives, provide one's resources, and furnish one's information. One rarely controls the circumstances of his work, or even its goal. In management terms, one's authority is not sufficient for
                              his responsibility. It seems that in all fields, however, the jobs where things get done never have formal authority commensurate with responsibility. In practice, actual (as opposed to formal) authority is acquired from
                              the very momentum of accomplishment.</p>
                            <p>The dependence upon others has a particular case that is especially painful for the system programmer. He depends upon other people's programs. These are often maldesigned, poorly implemented, incompletely delivered (no source
                              code or test cases), and poorly documented. So he must spend hours studying and fixing things that in an ideal world would be complete, available, and usable.</p>
                            <p>The next woe is that designing grand concepts is fun; finding nitty little bugs is just work. With any creative activity come dreary hours of tedious, painstaking labor, and programming is no exception.</p>
                            <p>Next, one finds that debugging has a linear convergence, or worse, where one somehow expects a quadratic sort of approach to the end. So testing drags on and on, the last difficult bugs taking more time to find than the first.</p>
                            <p>The last woe, and sometimes the last straw, is that the product over which one has labored so long appears to be obsolete upon (or before) completion. Already colleagues and competitors are in hot pursuit of new and better
                              ideas. Already the displacement of one's thought-child is not only conceived, but scheduled.</p>
                            <p>This always seems worse than it really is. The new and better product is generally not available when one completes his own; it is only talked about. It, too, will require months of development. The real tiger is never a match
                              for the paper one, unless actual use is wanted. Then the virtues of reality have a satisfaction all their own.</p>
                            <p>Of course the technological base on which one builds is always advancing. As soon as one freezes a design, it becomes obsolete in terms of its concepts. But implementation of real products demands phasing and quantizing. The
                              obsolescence of an implementation must be measured against other existing implementations, not against unrealized concepts. The challenge and the mission are to find real solutions to real problems on actual schedules with
                              available resources.</p>
                            <p>This then is programming, both a tar pit in which many efforts have floundered and a creative activity with joys and woes all its own. For many, the joys far outweigh the woes....</p>

                            <p><em>The Mythical Man-Month: Essays on Software Engineering</em> is a book on software engineering and project management by Fred Brooks, whose central theme is that &quot;adding manpower to a late software project makes it

                                        <li>If coding is a manufacturing activity, we wouldn’t be changing it so much after we code software. But if the code is in fact a ‘design’, yes, we would fiddle with it until we get it right.</li>
                                        <li>Manufacturing is the process of building a finished product based on the design. Code is the design. Manufacturing is what is done by the compiler (fully automated).</li>

                        <p><strong>Professional software engineers often write code using <em>Integrated Development Environments (IDEs)</em>. IDEs support all development-related work within the same tool.</strong></p>
                        <p>An IDE generally consists of:</p>
                        <ul>
                          <li>A source code editor that includes features such as syntax coloring, auto-completion, easy code navigation, error highlighting, and code-snippet generation.</li>
                          <li>A compiler and/or an interpreter (together with other build automation support) that facilitates the compilation/linking/running/deployment of a program.</li>
                          <li>A debugger that allows the developer to execute the program one step at a time to observe the run-time behavior in order to locate bugs.</li>
                          <li>Other tools that aid various aspects of coding e.g. support for automated testing, drag-and-drop construction of UI components, version management support, simulation of the target runtime platform, and modeling support.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Examples of popular IDEs:</p>
                        <ul>
                          <li>Java: Eclipse, Intellij IDEA, NetBeans</li>
                          <li>C#, C++: Visual Studio</li>
                          <li>Swift: XCode</li>
                          <li>Python: PyCharm</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Some Web-based IDEs have appeared in recent times too e.g., Amazon's <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cloud9/">Cloud9 IDE</a>.</p>
                        <p>Some experienced developers, in particular those with a UNIX background, prefer lightweight yet powerful text editors with scripting capabilities (e.g. <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/">Emacs</a>) over heavier IDEs.</p>

                              <blockquote>
                                <p>Software testing consists of the <em>dynamic</em> verification that a program provides <em>expected</em> behaviors on a <em>finite</em> set of test cases, suitably <em>selected</em> from the usually infinite execution domain.

                              <ul>
                                <li><em>Dynamic</em>: Testing involves executing the software. It is not by examining the code statically.</li>
                                <li><em>Finite</em>: In most non-trivial cases there are potentially infinite test scenarios but resource constraints dictate that we can test only a finite number of scenarios.</li>
                                <li><em>Selected</em>: In most cases it is not possible to test all scenarios. That means we need to select what scenarios to test.</li>
                                <li><em>Expected</em>: Testing requires some knowledge of how the software is expected to behave.</li>

                            <p>Regression testing is more effective when it is done frequently, after each small change. However, doing so can be prohibitively expensive if testing is done manually. Hence, <strong>regression testing is more practical when it is automated</strong>.</p>

                                    <p>💡 If you are using Windows, use a normal command window to run the app, not a Power Shell window.</p>

                                  <p>A CLI program takes input from the keyboard and outputs to the console. That is because those two are default input and output streams, respectively. But you can change that behavior using <code>&lt;</code> and <code>&gt;</code>                                    operators. For example, if you run <code>AddressBook</code> in a command window, the output will be shown in the console, but if you run it like this,</p>
                                  <pre><code class="hljs sh">java AddressBook &gt; output.txt 
</code></pre>
                                  <p>the Operating System then creates a file <code>output.txt</code> and stores the output in that file instead of displaying it in the console. No file I/O coding is required. Similarly, adding <code>&lt; input.txt</code>                                    (or any other filename) makes the OS redirect the contents of the file as input to the program, as if the user typed the content of the file one line at a time.</p>

                                <p>Next, we compare <code>output.txt</code> with the <code>expected.txt</code>. This can be done using a utility such as Windows <code>FC</code> (i.e. File Compare) command, Unix <code>diff</code> command, or a GUI tool such

                          <p>Revision control is also known as <em>Version Control Software (VCS)</em>, and a few other names. Here, we use the terms <em>revision</em> and <em>version</em> interchangeably.</p>

                              <blockquote>
                                <p><em>Revision control</em> is the process of managing multiple versions of a piece of information. In its simplest form, this is something that many people do by hand: every time you modify a file, save it under a new name
                                  that contains a number, each one higher than the number of the preceding version.</p>
                                <p>Manually managing multiple versions of even a single file is an error-prone task, though, so software tools to help automate this process have long been available. The earliest automated revision control tools were intended
                                  to help a single user to manage revisions of a single file. Over the past few decades, the scope of revision control tools has expanded greatly; they now manage multiple files, and help multiple people to work together.
                                  The best modern revision control tools have no problem coping with thousands of people working together on projects that consist of hundreds of thousands of files.</p>
                                <p>There are a number of reasons why you or your team might want to use an automated revision control tool for a project. It will track the history and evolution of your project, so you don't have to. For every change, you'll
                                  have a log of who made it; why they made it; when they made it; and what the change was.</p>
                                <p>When you're working with other people, <strong>revision control software makes it easier for you to collaborate</strong>. For example, when people more or less simultaneously make potentially incompatible changes, the software
                                  will help you to identify and resolve those conflicts.</p>
                                <p><strong>It can help you to recover from mistakes</strong>. If you make a change that later turns out to be an error, you can revert to an earlier version of one or more files. In fact, a really good revision control tool
                                  will even help you to efficiently figure out exactly when a problem was introduced.</p>
                                <p><strong>It will help you to work simultaneously on, and manage the drift between, multiple versions of your project.</strong> Most of these reasons are equally valid, at least in theory, whether you're working on a project
                                  by yourself, or with a hundred other people.</p>

                        <p>Note the existence of something called the <code>master</code> branch. Git allows you to have multiple branches (i.e. it is a way to evolve the content in parallel) and Git creates a default branch named <code>master</code> on
                          which the commits go on by default.</p>
                        <p>Do some changes to <code>fruits.txt</code> (e.g. add some text and delete some text). Stage the changes, and commit the changes using the same steps we followed before. You should end up with something like this.</p>

                            of <strong>improving a program's internal structure in small steps without modifying its external behavior is called <em>refactoring</em>.</strong></p>
                          <ul>
                            <li><strong>Refactoring is not rewriting</strong>: Discarding poorly-written code entirely and re-writing it from scratch is not refactoring because refactoring needs to be done in small steps.</li>
                            <li><strong>Refactoring is not bug fixing</strong>: By definition, refactoring is different from bug fixing or any other modifications that alter the external behavior (e.g. adding a feature) of the component in concern.</li>

                              <li>improve performance (sometimes, simpler code runs faster than complex code because simpler code is easier for the compiler to optimize).</li>

                          <p>We know that it is important to refactor frequently so as to avoid the accumulation of ‘messy’ code which might get out of control. But how much refactoring is too much refactoring? <strong>It is too much refactoring when the benefits no longer justify the cost.</strong>                            The costs and the benefits depend on the context. That is why some refactorings are ‘opposites’ of each other (e.g. <a href="https://refactoring.com/catalog/extractMethod.html"><em>extract method</em></a> vs <a href="https://refactoring.com/catalog/inlineMethod.html"><em>inline method</em></a>).</p>

                          <p><strong><em>Debugging</em> is the process of discovering defects in the program.</strong> Here are some approaches to debugging:</p>
                          <ul>
                            <li>
                              <p>👎 <strong>By inserting temporary print statements</strong>: This is an ad-hoc approach in which print statements are inserted in the program to print information relevant to debugging, such as variable values. e.g. <code>Exiting process() method, x is 5.347</code>.
                                This approach is not recommended due to these reasons.</p>
                              <ul>
                                <li>Incurs extra effort when inserting and removing the print statements.</li>
                                <li>Unnecessary program modifications increases the risk of introducing errors into the program.</li>
                                <li>These print statements, if not promptly removed, may even appear unexpectedly in the production version.</li>
                              </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                              <p>👎 <strong>By manually tracing through the code</strong>: Otherwise known as ‘eye-balling’, this approach doesn't have the cons of the previous approach, but it too is not recommended (other than as a 'quick try') due to
                                these reasons:</p>
                              <ul>
                                <li>It is difficult, time consuming, and error-prone technique.</li>
                                <li>If you didn't spot the error while writing code, you might not spot the error when reading code too.</li>
                              </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                              <p>👍 <strong>Using a debugger</strong>: A debugger tool allows you to pause the execution, then step through one statement at a time while examining the internal state if necessary. Most IDEs come with an inbuilt debugger.
                                <strong>This is the recommended approach for debugging</strong>.</p>

                          <p><strong>Remote repositories are copies of a repo that are hosted on remote computers.</strong> They are especially useful for sharing the revision history of a codebase among team members of a multi-person project. <span class="dimmed">They can also serve as a remote backup of your code base.</span></p>
                          <p><strong>You can <mark><em>clone</em></mark> a remote repo onto your computer</strong> which will create a copy of a remote repo on your computer, including the version history as the remote repo.</p>
                          <p><strong>You can <mark><em>push</em></mark> new commits in your clone to the remote repo</strong> which will copy the new commits onto the remote repo. Note that pushing to a remote repo requires you to have write-access to it.</p>
                          <p><strong>You can <mark><em>pull</em></mark> from the remote repos to receive new commits in the remote repo</strong>. Pulling is used to <em>sync</em> your local repo with latest changes to the remote repo.</p>
                          <p>While it is possible to set up your own remote repo on a server, an easier option is to use a remote repo hosting service such as GitHub or BitBucket.</p>
                          <p><strong>A <mark><em>fork</em></mark> is a remote copy of a remote repo</strong>. If there is a remote repo that you want to push to but you do not have write access to it, you can fork the remote repo, which gives you your own
                            remote repo that you can push to.</p>
                          <p><strong>A <mark><em>pull request</em></mark> is mechanism for contributing code to a remote repo.</strong> It is a formal request sent to the maintainers of the repo asking them to pull your new code to their repo.</p>

                              <p>(a) The local repo is now at this commit, marked by the <code>master</code> label.<br> (b) <code>origin/master</code> shows what is the latest commit in the <code>master</code> branch in the remote repo.</p>

                        <p>Now, your local repo state is exactly how it would be if you had cloned the repo 2 commits ago, as if somebody has added two more commits to the remote repo since you cloned it. To get those commits to your local repo (i.e. to
                          sync your local repo with upstream repo) you can do a pull.</p>

                            <p>Given their lightweight nature, <strong>user stories are quite handy for recording requirements during early requirements gathering</strong>.</p>
                            <tip-box>
                              <p>💡 Here are some tips for using user stories for early stages of requirement gathering:</p>
                              <ul>
                                <li><strong>Define the <em>target user</em>:</strong><br> Decide your target user's profile (e.g. a student, office worker, programmer, sales person) and work patterns (e.g. Does he work in groups or alone? Does he share his
                                  computer with others?). A clear understanding of the target user will help when deciding the importance of a user story. You can even give this user a name. <span class="dimmed"> e.g. Target user Jean is a university student studying in a non-IT field. She interacts with a lot of people due to her involvement in university clubs/societies. ...</span></li>
                                <li><strong>Define the <em>problem scope</em>:</strong> Decide that exact problem you are going to solve for the target user. <span class="dimmed"> e.g. Help Jean keep track of all her school contacts</span></li>
                                <li><strong>Don't be too hasty to discard 'unusual' user stories:</strong><br> Those might make your product unique and stand out from the rest, at least for the target users.</li>
                                <li><strong>Don't go into too much details:</strong><br> For example, consider this user story: <code>As a user, I want to see a list of tasks that needs my attention most at the present time, so that I pay attention to them first.</code><br>                                  When discussing this user story, don't worry about what tasks should be considered <em>needs my attention most at the present time</em>. Those details can be worked out later.</li>
                                <li><strong>Don't be biased by preconceived product ideas:</strong><br> When you are at the stage of identifying user needs, clear your mind of ideas you have about what your end product will look like.</li>
                                <li><strong>Don't discuss implementation details or whether you are actually going to implement it:</strong><br> When gathering requirements, your decision is whether the user's need is important enough for you to want to fulfil
                                  it. Implementation details can be discussed later. If a user story turns out to be too difficult to implement later, you can always omit it from the implementation plan.</li>
                              </ul>
                            </tip-box>

                          <p>While use cases can be recorded on
                            <tooltip content="e.g. index cards or sticky notes">physical paper</tooltip> in the initial stages, an online tool is more suitable for longer-term management of user stories, especially if the team is not

                              <p>One of the biggest misunderstandings with user stories is how they differ from traditional requirements specifications. The biggest difference is in the level of detail. User stories should only provide enough detail to make
                                a reasonably low risk estimate of how long the story will take to implement. When the time comes to implement the story developers will go to the customer and receive a detailed description of the requirements face to face.</p>

                                    <p>Consider a simple movie ticket vending machine application. Every week, the theatre staff will enter the weekly schedule as well as ticket price for each show. A customer sees the schedule and the ticket price displayed
                                      at the machine. There is a slot to insert money, a keypad to enter a code for a movie, a code for the show time, and the number of tickets. A display shows the customer's balance inside the machine. A customer may
                                      choose to cancel a transaction before pressing the “buy” button. Printed tickets can be collected from a slot at the bottom of the machine. The machine also displays messages such as &quot;Please enter more money”,
                                      “Request fewer tickets&quot; or &quot;SOLD OUT!”. Finally, a &quot;Return Change&quot; button allows the customer to get back his unspent money.</p>

                                    <p>The system is to be used by Testers, Programmers and System Administrators. Only an administrator can create new users and assign tasks to programmers. Any tester can create a bug report, as well as set the status of
                                      a bug report as ‘closed’. Only a programmer can set the state of a bug report to ‘fixed’, but a programmer cannot set the status of a bug report to ‘closed’. Each tester is assigned just one task at a time. A task
                                      involves testing of a particular component for a particular customer. Tester must document the bugs they find. Each bug is given a unique identifier. Other information recorded about the bug is component id, severity,
                                      date and time reported, programmer who is assigned to fix it, date fixed, date retested and date closed. The system keeps track of which bugs are assigned to which programmer at any given time. It should be able to
                                      generate reports on the number of bugs found, fixed and closed e.g. number of bugs per component and per customer; number of bugs found by a particular tester ; number of bugs awaiting to be fixed; number of bugs
                                      awaiting to be retested; number of bugs awaiting to be assigned to programmers etc.</p>

                                      <p><strong>Explanation</strong>: The given description contains information not relevant to use case modeling. Furthermore, the description is not enough to complete the use case diagram All these are realities of real
                                        projects. However, the process of trying to create this use case diagram prompts us to investigate issues such as:</p>
                                      <ul>
                                        <li>Is ‘edit bug report’ a use case or editing the bug report is covered by other use cases such as those for setting the status of bug reports? If it is indeed a separate use case, who are the actors of that use case?</li>
                                        <li>Does ‘assign task’ simply means ‘assign bug report’ or is there any other type of tasks?</li>
                                        <li>There was some mention about Customers and Components. Does the system have to support use cases for creating and maintaining details about those entities? For example, should we have a ‘create customer record’
                                          use case?</li>
                                        <li>Which actors can perform the ‘generate report’ use case? Are reports generated automatically by the system at a specific time or generated ‘on demand’ when users request to view them? Do we have to treat different
                                          types of reports as different use cases (in case some types of reports are restricted to some types of users)? The above diagram assumes (just for illustration) that the report is generated on demand and only
                                          the system admin can generate any report.</li>

                          <p><strong>You can use actor generalization in use case diagrams</strong> using a symbol similar to that of UML notation for inheritance.</p>
                          <tip-box>
                            <p><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-gift" aria-hidden="true"></span> In this example, actor <code>Blogger</code> can do all the use cases the actor <code>Guest</code> can do, as a result of the actor generalization relationship
                              given in the diagram.</p>
                            <img src="/website-base/book/specifyingRequirements/useCases/usage/images/actorGeneralisation.png" height="250"></tip-box>
                          <p>💡 Do not over-complicate use case diagrams by trying to include everything possible. A use case diagram is a brief summary of the use cases that is used as a starting point. Details of the use cases can be given in the use case
                            descriptions.</p>
                          <p><strong>Some include ‘System’ as an actor to indicate that something is done by the system itself without being initiated by a user or an external system.</strong></p>
                          <tip-box>
                            <p><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-gift" aria-hidden="true"></span> The diagram below can be used to indicate that the system generates daily reports at midnight.</p>
                            <img src="/website-base/book/specifyingRequirements/useCases/usage/images/systemAsActor.jpg" height="200"></tip-box>
                          <p>However, others argue that only use cases providing value to an external user/system should be shown in the use case diagram. For example, they argue that ‘view daily report’ should be the use case and <code>generate daily report</code>                            is not to be shown in the use case diagram because it is simply something the system has to do to support the <code>view daily report</code> use case.</p>
                          <p>We recommend that you follow the latter view (i.e. not to use System as a user). Limit use cases for modeling behaviors that involve an external actor.</p>
                          <p><strong>UML is not very specific about the text contents of a use case.</strong> Hence, there are many styles for writing use cases. For example, the steps can be written as a continuous paragraph. Use cases should be easy to
                            read. Note that there is no strict rule about writing all details of all steps or a need to use all the elements of a use case.</p>
                          <p><strong>There are some advantages of documenting system requirements as use cases:</strong></p>
                          <ul>
                            <li>Because they use a simple notation and plain English descriptions, they are easy for users to understand and give feedback.</li>
                            <li>They decouple user intention from mechanism (note that use cases should not include UI-specific details), allowing the system designers more freedom to optimize how a functionality is provided to a user.</li>
                            <li>Identifying all possible extensions encourages us to consider all situations that a software product might face during its operation.</li>
                            <li>Separating typical scenarios from special cases encourages us to optimize the typical scenarios.</li>
                          </ul>
                          <p><strong>One of the main disadvantages of use cases is that they are not good for capturing requirements that does not involve a user interacting with the system.</strong> Hence, they should not be used as the sole means to specify
                            requirements.</p>

                                        <p><strong>Abstraction</strong> is a technique for dealing with complexity. It works by establishing a level of complexity (or an aspect) we are interested in, and suppressing the more complex details below that level
                                          (or irrelevant to that aspect).</p>

                                    <p>Most programs are written to solve complex problems involving large amounts of intricate details. It is impossible to deal with all these details at the same time. The guiding principle of abstraction stipulates that
                                      we capture only details that are relevant to the current perspective or the task at hand.</p>

                              <p><strong><em>Model-driven development (MDD)</em>, also called <em>Model-driven engineering</em>, is an approach to software development that strives to exploits models as blueprints.</strong> MDD uses models as primary engineering
                                artifacts when developing software. That is, the system is first created in the form of models. After that, the models are converted to code using code-generation techniques (usually, automated or semi-automated, but can
                                even involve manual translation from model to code). MDD requires the use of a very expressive modeling notation (graphical or otherwise), often specific to a given problem domain. It also requires sophisticated tools to
                                generate code from models and maintain the link between models and the code. One advantage of MDD is that the same model can be used to create software for different platforms and different languages. MDD has a lot of promise,
                                but it is still an emerging technology</p>

                          <p><strong>Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a <em>programming paradigm</em>.</strong> A programming paradigm guides programmers to analyze programming problems, and structure programming solutions, in a specific way.</p>
                          <blockquote>
                            <p>Programming languages have traditionally divided the world into two parts—data and operations on data. Data is static and immutable, except as the operations may change it. The procedures and functions that operate on data
                              have no lasting state of their own; they’re useful only in their ability to affect data.</p>
                            <p>This division is, of course, grounded in the way computers work, so it’s not one that you can easily ignore or push aside. Like the equally pervasive distinctions between matter and energy and between nouns and verbs, it forms
                              the background against which we work. At some point, all programmers—even object-oriented programmers—must lay out the data structures that their programs will use and define the functions that will act on the data.</p>
                            <p>With a procedural programming language like C, that’s about all there is to it. The language may offer various kinds of support for organizing data and functions, but it won’t divide the world any differently. Functions and
                              data structures are the basic elements of design.</p>
                            <p>Object-oriented programming doesn’t so much dispute this view of the world as restructure it at a higher level. It groups operations and data into modular units called objects and lets you combine objects into structured networks
                              to form a complete program. In an object-oriented programming language, objects and object interactions are the basic elements of design.</p>

                              its contents are) with behavior (the ability to dispense its contents at various flow rates, to be opened or closed, to withstand high or low temperatures).</p>
                            <p>It’s this resemblance to real things that gives objects much of their power and appeal. They can not only model components of real systems, but equally as well fulfill assigned roles as components in software systems.</p>

                            <p>You are asked to find out the average age of a group of people Adam, Beth, Charlie, and Daisy. You take a piece of paper and pen, go to each person, ask for their age, and note it down. After collecting the age of all four,
                              you enter it into a calculator to find the total. And then, use the same calculator to divide the total by four, to get the average age. This can be viewed as the objects <code>You</code>, <code>Pen</code>, <code>Paper</code>,
                              <code>Calculator</code>, <code>Adam</code>, <code>Beth</code>, <code>Charlie</code>, and <code>Daisy</code> interacting to accomplish to achieve the end result of calculating the average age of the four persons. These objects
                              can be considered as connected in a certain network of certain structure.</p>

                          <p><strong>OOP solutions try to create a similar object network inside the computer’s memory</strong> – a sort of a virtual simulation of the corresponding real world scenario – <strong>so that a similar result can be achieved programmatically.</strong></p>

                          <p><strong>OOP does not demand that the virtual world object network follow the real world <em>exactly</em>.</strong></p>

                          </ol>
                          <p><strong>A <mark><em>class</em></mark> contains instructions for creating a specific kind of objects</strong>. It turns out sometimes multiple objects have the same behavior because they are of the same kind. Instructions for
                            creating a one kind (or ‘class’) of objects can be done in one go and use that same instructions to instantiate (i.e. create) objects of that kind. We call such instructions a <em>Class</em>.</p>

                            <p>When writing an OOP program to calculate the average age of Adam, Beth, Charlie, and Daisy, instructions for creating objects <code>Adam</code>, <code>Beth</code>, <code>Charlie</code>, and <code>Daisy</code> will be very similar
                              because they are all of the same kind : they all represent ‘persons’ with the same interface, the same kind of data (i.e. <code>name</code>, <code>DoB</code>, etc.), and the same kind of behavior (i.e. <code>getAge(Date)</code>,
                              <code>getName()</code>, etc.). Therefore, we can have a class called <code>Person</code> containing instructions on how to create <code>Person</code> objects and use that class to instantiate objects <code>Adam</code>, <code>Beth</code>,
                              <code>Charlie</code>, and <code>Daisy</code>. Similarly, we need classes <code>AgeList</code>, <code>Calculator</code>, and <code>Main</code> classes to instantiate one each of <code>AgeList</code>, <code>Calculator</code>,
                              and <code>Main</code> objects.</p>

                          <p>An enumeration is often useful when using a regular data type such as <code>int</code> or <code>String</code> would allow invalid values to be assigned to a variable. <span class="dimmed">e.g. if a variable can only take values <code>0</code> and <code>1</code>, declaring it as an <code>int</code> would allow invalid values such as <code>2</code> to be assigned to it. But if you define an enumeration called <code>Binary</code> that has values <code>0</code> and <code>1</code> only, a variable of type <code>Binary</code> will never be assigned an invalid value such as <code>2</code> because the compiler is able to catch the error.</span></p>

                          <p>A common newbie mistake when creating branch-based PRs is to mix commits of one PR with another. To learn how to avoid that mistake, you are encouraged to continue and create another PR as explained below.

                                        instance level as their value varies from instance to instance. e.g., <code>totalStudents</code> for one <code>Course</code> object will differ from <code>totalStudents</code> of another.</p>

                              clarity.</p>

                          <p>Take the example of writing a payroll application for a university to facilitate payroll processing of university staff. Suppose an <code>adjustSalary(int)</code> operation adjusts the salaries of all staff members. This operation
                            will be executed whenever the university initiates a salary adjustment for its staff. However, the adjustment formula is different for different staff categories, say admin and academic. Here is one possible way of designing
                            the classes in the <code>Payroll</code> system.</p>

                            <p>Here is the implementation of the <code>adjustSalary(int)</code> operation from the above design.</p>

                          <p>Note how processing is similar for the two staff types. It is as if the type of staff members is irrelevant to how they are processed inside this operation! If that is the case, can the staff type be &quot;abstracted away&quot;
                            from this method? Here is such an implementation of <code>adjustSalary(int)</code>:</p>
                          <tip-box>
                            <pre><code class="hljs java"><span class="hljs-class"><span class="hljs-keyword">class</span> <span class="hljs-title">Payroll2</span> </span>{
    ArrayList&lt; Staff &gt; staff;

        <span class="hljs-keyword">for</span> (Staff s: staff) {
            s.adjustSalary(byPercent);
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>
                            <p>Notice the following:</p>
                            <ul>
                              <li>Only one data structure <code>ArrayList&lt; Staff &gt;</code>. It contains both <code>Admin</code> and <code>Academic</code> objects but treats them as <code>Staff</code> objects</li>
                              <li>Only one loop</li>
                              <li>Outcome of the <code>s.adjustSalary(byPercent)</code> method call depends on whether <code>s</code> is an <code>Academic</code> or <code>Admin</code> object</li>
                            </ul>
                          </tip-box>
                          <p>The above code is better in several ways:</p>
                          <ul>
                            <li>It is shorter.</li>
                            <li>It is simpler.</li>
                            <li>It is more flexible (this code will remain the same even if more staff types are added).</li>
                          </ul>
                          <p>This does not mean we are getting rid of the <code>Academic</code> and <code>Admin</code> classes completely and replacing them with a more general class called <code>Staff</code>. Rather, this part of the code “treats” both
                            <code>Admin</code> and <code>Academic</code> objects as one type called <code>Staff</code>.</p>
                          <p>For example, <code>ArrayList</code> staff contains both <code>Admin</code> and <code>Academic</code> objects although it treats all of them as <code>Staff</code> objects. However, when the <code>adjustSalary(int)</code> operation
                            of these objects is called, the resulting salary adjustment will be different for <code>Admin</code> objects and <code>Academic</code> objects. Therefore, different types of objects are treated as a single general type, but
                            yet each type of object exhibits a different kind of behavior. This is called <em>polymorphism</em> (literally, it means “ability to take many forms”). In this example, an object that is perceived as type <code>Staff</code>                            can be an <code>Admin</code> object or an <code>Academic</code> object.</p>

                                      <p>Take the example of writing a payroll application for a university to facilitate payroll processing of university staff. Suppose an <code>adjustSalary(int)</code> operation adjusts the salaries of all staff members.
                                        This operation will be executed whenever the university initiates a salary adjustment for its staff. However, the adjustment formula is different for different staff categories, say admin and academic. Here is one
                                        possible way of designing the classes in the <code>Payroll</code> system.</p>
                                      <tip-box>
                                        <p><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-gift" aria-hidden="true"></span> Calling <code>adjustSalary()</code> method for each Staff type:</p>

                                        <p>Here is the implementation of the <code>adjustSalary(int)</code> operation from the above design.</p>

                                      <p>Note how processing is similar for the two staff types. It is as if the type of staff members is irrelevant to how they are processed inside this operation! If that is the case, can the staff type be &quot;abstracted
                                        away&quot; from this method? Here is such an implementation of <code>adjustSalary(int)</code>:</p>
                                      <tip-box>
                                        <pre><code class="hljs java"><span class="hljs-class"><span class="hljs-keyword">class</span> <span class="hljs-title">Payroll2</span> </span>{

            s.adjustSalary(byPercent);
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>
                                        <p>Notice the following:</p>
                                        <ul>
                                          <li>Only one data structure <code>ArrayList&lt; Staff &gt;</code>. It contains both <code>Admin</code> and <code>Academic</code> objects but treats them as <code>Staff</code> objects</li>
                                          <li>Only one loop</li>
                                          <li>Outcome of the <code>s.adjustSalary(byPercent)</code> method call depends on whether <code>s</code> is an <code>Academic</code> or <code>Admin</code> object</li>
                                        </ul>
                                      </tip-box>
                                      <p>The above code is better in several ways:</p>
                                      <ul>
                                        <li>It is shorter.</li>
                                        <li>It is simpler.</li>
                                        <li>It is more flexible (this code will remain the same even if more staff types are added).</li>
                                      </ul>
                                      <p>This does not mean we are getting rid of the <code>Academic</code> and <code>Admin</code> classes completely and replacing them with a more general class called <code>Staff</code>. Rather, this part of the code “treats”
                                        both <code>Admin</code> and <code>Academic</code> objects as one type called <code>Staff</code>.</p>
                                      <p>For example, <code>ArrayList</code> staff contains both <code>Admin</code> and <code>Academic</code> objects although it treats all of them as <code>Staff</code> objects. However, when the <code>adjustSalary(int)</code>                                        operation of these objects is called, the resulting salary adjustment will be different for <code>Admin</code> objects and <code>Academic</code> objects. Therefore, different types of objects are treated as a single
                                        general type, but yet each type of object exhibits a different kind of behavior. This is called <em>polymorphism</em> (literally, it means “ability to take many forms”). In this example, an object that is perceived
                                        as type <code>Staff</code> can be an <code>Admin</code> object or an <code>Academic</code> object.</p>

                          <ul>
                            <li><strong>Locating the cause of such a test case failure is difficult due to a large search space;</strong> in a large system, the search space could be millions of lines of code, written by hundreds of developers! The failure
                              may also be due to multiple inter-related bugs.</li>
                            <li><strong>Fixing a bug found during such testing could result in major rework</strong>, especially if the bug originated during the design or during requirements specification <span class="dimmed">i.e. a faulty design or faulty requirements</span>.</li>
                            <li><strong>One bug might 'hide' other bugs</strong>, which could emerge only after the first bug is fixed.</li>
                            <li><strong>The delivery may have to be delayed</strong> if too many bugs were found during testing.</li>

                                        <li>Can be done early (the earlier we find a bug, the cheaper it is to fix).</li>
                                        <li>Can be done at lower levels, for examples, at operation and class level (testers usually test the system at UI level).</li>
                                        <li>It is possible to do more thorough testing because developers know the expected external behavior as well as the internal structure of the component.</li>
                                        <li>It forces developers to take responsibility for their own work (they cannot claim that &quot;testing is the job of the testers&quot;).</li>

                                        <li>A developer may unconsciously test only situations that he knows to work (i.e. test it too 'gently').</li>
                                        <li>A developer may be blind to his own mistakes (if he did not consider a certain combination of input while writing code, it is possible for him to miss it again during testing).</li>
                                        <li>A developer may have misunderstood what the SUT is supposed to do in the first place.</li>
                                        <li>A developer may lack the testing expertise.</li>

                          <p><strong>2. Switch back to <code>master</code> branch. Create a commit with a conflicting change</strong> i.e. it adds a line with some different text in the exact location the previous line was added.</p>

                          <p><strong>3. Try to merge the <code>fix1</code> branch onto the <code>master</code> branch.</strong> Git will pause mid-way during the merge and report a merge conflict. If you open the conflicted file, you will see something like
                            this:</p>
                          <pre class="hljs"><code>COLORS

                            starting with <code>=======</code>.</p>
                          <p>This is the conflicting part that is coming from the <code>master</code> branch:</p>

                          <p><strong>5. Resolve the conflict by editing the file</strong>. Let us assume you want to keep both lines in the merged version. You can modify the file to be like this:</p>

red
white

                          <p>1a. Go to the respective PR page and click on the <code>Files changed</code> tab. Hover over the line you want to comment on and click on the <code>+</code> icon that appears on the left margin. That should create a text box
                            for you to enter your comment.</p>

                          <p><strong>2. Update the PR</strong> to simulate revising the code based on reviewer comments. Add some more commits to the <code>add-intro</code> branch and push the new commits to the fork. Observe how the PR is updated automatically
                            to reflect the new code.</p>
                          <p><strong>3. Merge the PR.</strong> Go to the GitHub page of the respective PR, scroll to the bottom of the <code>Conversation</code> tab, and click on the <code>Merge pull request</code> button, followed by the <code>Confirm merge</code>                            button. You should see a <code>Pull request successfully merged and closed</code> message after the PR is merged.</p>

                          <p><strong>4. Sync the local repo with the remote repo.</strong> Because of the merge you did on the GitHub, the <code>master</code> branch of your fork is now ahead of your local repo by one commit. To sync the local repo with
                            the remote repo, pull the <code>master</code> branch to the local repo.</p>

                          <p><strong>5. De-conflict the <code>add-summary</code> PR.</strong> Note that GitHub page for the <code>add-summary</code> PR is now showing a conflict <span class="dimmed">(when you scroll to the bottom of that page, you should see a message <code>This branch has conflicts that must be resolved</code>)</span>.
                            You can resolve it locally and update the PR accordingly, as explained below.</p>
                          <p>5a. Switch to the <code>add-summary</code> branch. To make that branch up-to-date with the <code>master</code> branch, merge the <code>master</code> branch to it, which will surface the merge conflict. Resolve it and complete
                            the merge.</p>
                          <p>5b. Push the updated <code>add-summary</code> branch to the fork. That will remove the 'merge conflicts' warning in the GitHub page of the PR.</p>
                          <p><strong>6. Merge the <code>add-summary</code> PR</strong> using the GitHub interface, similar to how you merged the previous PR.</p>

                            <p>Note that you could have merged the <code>add-summary</code> branch to the <code>master</code> branch locally before pushing it to GitHub. In that case, the PR will be merged on GitHub automatically to reflect that the branch

                          <p><strong>In the <em>forking workflow</em>, the 'official' version of the software is kept in a remote repo designated as the 'main repo'. All team members fork the main repo create pull requests from their fork to the main repo.</strong></p>
                          <p>To illustrate how the workflow goes, let’s assume Jean wants to fix a bug in the code. Here are the steps:</p>
                          <ol>
                            <li>Jean creates a separate branch in her local repo and fixes the bug in that branch.</li>
                            <li>Jean pushes the branch to her fork.</li>
                            <li>Jean creates a pull request from that branch in her fork to the main repo.</li>
                            <li>Other members review Jean’s pull request.</li>
                            <li>If reviewers suggested any changes, Jean updates the PR accordingly.</li>
                            <li>When reviewers are satisfied with the PR, one of the members (usually the team lead or a designated 'maintainer' of the main repo) merges the PR, which brings Jean’s code to the main repo.</li>
                            <li>Other members, realizing there is new code in the upstream repo, sync their forks with the new upstream repo (i.e. the main repo). This is done by pulling the new code to their own local repo and pushing the updated code to
                              their own fork.</li>

                          <p><strong>RCS can be done in two ways: the <em>centralized</em> way and the <em>distributed</em> way.</strong></p>
                          <p><strong>Centralized RCS (CRCS for short)uses a central remote repo that is shared by the team.</strong> Team members download (‘pull’) and upload (‘push’) changes between their own local repositories and the central repository.
                            Older RCS tools such as CVS and SVN support only this model. Note that these older RCS do not support the notion of a local repo either. Instead, they force users to do all the versioning with the remote repo.</p>

                            <strong>The centralized RCS approach without any local repos (e.g., CVS, SVN)</strong></pic>
                          <p><strong>Distributed RCS (DRCS for short, also known as Decentralized RCS) allows multiple remote repos</strong> and pulling and pushing can be done among them in arbitrary ways. The workflow can vary differently from team to
                            team. For example, every team member can have his/her own remote repository in addition to their own local repository, as shown in the diagram below. Git and Mercurial are some prominent RCS tools that support the distributed
                            approach.</p>

                  This LO requires coordination and cooperation among team members. It also requires a few days to complete; we recommend that you start it early in the week rather than just before the tutorial day.
                </tip-box>
                <p>This LO can earn you 2 participation marks, 1 mark for the individual component and 1 for the team component.</p>
                <p>💡 When working with existing code, a safe approach is to <strong>change the code in very small steps, each resulting in a verifiable change</strong> without breaking the app. For example, when adding a new <code>sort</code> command, the
                  first few steps can be,</p>
                <ol>
                  <li>Teach the app to accept a <code>sort</code> command but ignore it.</li>
                  <li>Next, teach the app to direct the <code>sort</code> command to an existing command e.g. <code>sort</code> command simply invokes the <code>list</code> command internally.</li>
                  <li>Add a <code>SortCommand</code> class but make it simply a copy of the the existing <code>ListCommand</code>. Direct the <code>sort</code> command to the new <code>SortCommand</code>.</li>
                  <li>...</li>
                </ol>
                <p>💡 Note that you can reuse the code you write here in your final project, if applicable.</p>

                          <p><strong><em>Logging</em> is the deliberate recording of certain information during a program execution for future reference.</strong> Logs are typically written to a log file but it is also possible to log information in other
                            ways <span class="dimmed"> e.g. into a database or a remote server</span>.</p>
                          <p><strong><em>Logging</em> can be useful for troubleshooting problems</strong>. A good logging system records some system information regularly. When bad things happen to a system <span class="dimmed"> e.g. an unanticipated failure</span>,
                            their associated log files may provide indications of what went wrong and action can then be taken to prevent it from happening again.</p>

                              <p>Now, we need to create the <em>main Java class</em> that starts up our application with the <code>RootLayout.fxml</code> and adds the <code>PersonOverview.fxml</code> in the center.</p>
                              <p>Right-click on your <code>seedu.address</code> package, and choose <code>New</code> → <code>JavaFXApplication</code>. For the class name, type <code>MainApp</code>.</p>
                              <p>The generated <code>MainApp.java</code> class extends from <code>Application</code> and contains two methods. This is the basic structure that we need to start a JavaFX Application. The most important part for us is the <code>start(Stage primaryStage)</code>                                method. It is automatically called when the application is <code>launch()</code> from within the <code>main()</code> method.</p>
                              <p>As you see, the <code>start(...)</code> method receives a <code>Stage</code> as parameter. The following graphic illustrates the structure of every JavaFX application:</p>

                              <p><em>It's like a theater play:</em> The <code>Stage</code> is the main container which is usually a <code>Window</code> with a border and the typical minimize, maximize and close buttons. Inside the <code>Stage</code> you
                                add a <code>Scene</code> which can, of course, be switched out by another <code>Scene</code>. Inside the <code>Scene</code> the actual JavaFX nodes like <code>AnchorPane</code>, <code>TextBox</code>, etc. are added.</p>

                                <li>With JavaFX, it is common to use <code>*Property</code> for all fields of a model class. A <code>Property</code> allows us, for example, to automatically be notified when the <code>lastName</code> or any other variable
                                  is changed. This helps us keep the view in sync with the data.</li>
                                <li>To learn more about <code>*Property</code>, refer to <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/javafx/properties-binding-tutorial/binding.htm">Using JavaFX Properties and Binding</a></li>
                                <li><code>LocalDate</code>, the type that we are using for <code>birthday</code>, is part of the <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/datetime/iso/">new Date and Time API for JDK 8</a></li>

                              <p>The main data that our application manages is simply a bunch of persons. Let's create a list of <code>Person</code> objects inside the <code>MainApp</code> class. All other controller classes will later get access to that

                              <p>We are working with JavaFX view classes that need to be informed about any changes made to the list of persons. This is important, since otherwise the view would not be in sync with the data. For this purpose, JavaFX introduces
                                some new <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/javafx/collections-tutorial/collections.htm">Collection classes</a>.</p>
                              <p>Among all these collections, we need the <code>ObservableList</code>. To create a new <code>ObservableList</code>, add the following code at the beginning of the <code>MainApp</code> class. We'll also add a constructor that
                                creates some sample data and a public getter method:</p>

                              <p>We have our model and view. Let's get our data into our table. We'll need a controller for our <code>PersonOverview.fxml</code> to act as a &quot;middleman&quot; for the model and view.</p>
                              <p>Create a normal Java class inside the <code>view</code> package called <code>PersonOverviewController</code>.</p>
                              <tip-box type="tip">
                                <p>Note: We must put the class inside the same package as <code>PersonOverview.fxml</code>, otherwise the SceneBuilder won't be able to find it.</p>
                              </tip-box>
                              <p>We will add some instance variables that give us access to the table and the labels inside the view. The fields and some methods have a special <code>@FXML</code> annotation. This is necessary in order for the <code>.fxml</code>                                file to have access to private fields and private methods. After we have everything set up in the <code>.fxml</code> file, the application will automatically fill the variables when the <code>.fxml</code> file is loaded.</p>
                              <p>So let's add the following code:</p>

                        <p><strong>Build automation tools automate the steps of the build process, usually by means of build scripts.</strong></p>
                        <p>In a non-trivial project, building a product from source code can be a complex multi-step process. <span class="dimmed"> For example, it can include steps such as to pull code from the revision control system, compile, link, run automated tests, automatically update release documents (e.g. build number), package into a distributable, push to repo, deploy to a server, delete temporary files created during building/testing, email developers of the new build, and so on. Furthermore, this build process can be done ‘on demand’, it can be scheduled (e.g. every day at midnight) or it can be triggered by various events (e.g. triggered by a code push to the revision control system).</span></p>
                        <p>Some of these build steps such as to compile, link and package are already automated in most modern IDEs. <span class="dimmed"> For example, several steps happen automatically when the ‘build’ button of the IDE is clicked. Some IDEs even allow customization to this build process to some extent.</span></p>
                        <p>However, most big projects use specialized build tools to automate complex build processes.</p>

                          <ul>
                            <li><a href="https://gradle.org/">Gradle</a></li>

                        </tip-box>
                        <p><strong>Some build tools also serve as <em>dependency management tools</em></strong>. Modern software projects often depend on third party libraries that evolve constantly. That means developers need to download the correct version
                          of the required libraries and update them regularly. Therefore, dependency management is an important part of build automation. Dependency Management tools can automate that aspect of a project.</p>
                        <tip-box>
                          <p><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-gift" aria-hidden="true"></span> Maven and Gradle, in addition to managing the build process, can play the role of dependency management tools too.</p>

                <p>Imagine you are building an online system called TeamFormer. A brief description of it is given below.</p>
                <tip-box>
                  <p>TeamFormer is a system for helping CS2103 students during team forming period. It lets students record who is in which team. Students can use the system to find teams short of members and students looking for teams, easing the team forming
                    process. Note that the system is not meant as a platform for students to communicate with each other to find team members. Students are supposed to talk to each other and form teams outside the system, as they do now. TeamFormer simply
                    helps students to see the team forming status of the class (e.g., who has teams and who doesn’t) and record their own team after forming a team. It is also meant to ease the team-forming-related workload of instructors.</p>

                            of opening and closing braces, indentation styles and naming styles (e.g. whether to use Hungarian style, Pascal casing, Camel casing, etc.). It is important that the whole team/company use the same coding standard and that
                            standard is not generally inconsistent with typical industry practices. <span class="dimmed">If a company's coding standards is very different from what is used typically in the industry, new recruits will take longer to get used to the company's coding style.</span></p>

                        <p><strong>Among various dimensions of code quality, such as run-time efficiency, security, and robustness, one of the most important is understandability.</strong> This is because in any non-trivial software project, code needs to
                          be read, understood, and modified by other developers later on. Even if we do not intend to pass the code to someone else, code quality is still important because we all become 'strangers' to our own code someday.</p>

                            intermediary steps. Nevertheless, this order may affect the clarity of the story you are trying to tell. Choose the order that makes the story most readable.</p>

                          <p><strong>Optimizing code prematurely has several drawbacks</strong>:</p>
                          <ul>
                            <li><strong>We may not know which parts are the real performance bottlenecks</strong>. This is especially the case when the code undergoes transformations (e.g. compiling, minifying, transpiling, etc.) before it becomes an executable.
                              Ideally, you should use a profiler tool to identify the actual bottlenecks of the code first, and optimize only those parts.</li>
                            <li><strong>Optimizing can complicate the code</strong>, affecting correctness and understandability</li>
                            <li><strong>Hand-optimized code can be harder for the compiler to optimize</strong> (the simpler the code, the easier for the compiler to optimize it). In many cases a compiler can do a better job of optimizing the runtime code
                              if you don't get in the way by trying to hand-optimize the source code.</li>
                          </ul>
                          <p>A popular saying in the industry is <strong><em>make it work, make it right, make it fast</em></strong> which means in most cases getting the code to perform correctly should take priority over optimizing it. If the code doesn't
                            work correctly, it has no value on matter how fast/efficient it it.</p>

                            optimize only when it is really needed.</p>

                                        <p><strong>Abstraction</strong> is a technique for dealing with complexity. It works by establishing a level of complexity (or an aspect) we are interested in, and suppressing the more complex details below that level
                                          (or irrelevant to that aspect).</p>

                                    <p>Most programs are written to solve complex problems involving large amounts of intricate details. It is impossible to deal with all these details at the same time. The guiding principle of abstraction stipulates that
                                      we capture only details that are relevant to the current perspective or the task at hand.</p>

                          <p>The happy path (i.e. the execution path taken when everything goes well) should be clear and prominent in your code. Restructure the code to make the happy path unindented as much as possible. It is the ‘unusual’ cases that should
                            be indented. Someone reading the code should not get distracted by alternative paths taken when error conditions happen. One technique that could help in this regard is the use of <a href="http://wiki.c2.com/?GuardClause">guard clauses</a>.</p>

                          <p>Furthermore, use it for the intended default action and not just to execute the last option. If there is no default action, you can use the 'default' branch to detect errors (i.e. if execution reached the <code>default</code>                            branch, throw an exception). This also applies to the final <code>else</code> of an <code>if-else</code> construct. That is, the final <code>else</code> should mean 'everything else', and not the final option. Do not use <code>else</code>                            when an <code>if</code> condition can be explicitly specified, unless there is absolutely no other possibility.</p>
