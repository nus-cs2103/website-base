**Questions to discuss during tutorial:**

1. What’s the use of assertions?
1. Demonstrate an assertion failure using Intellij.
1. Why do we need logging? What’s the purpose of logging levels? What are the available logging levels in AB4?
1. Explain what Gradle is. How is it used in AB4?
1. Explain what Travis is. How is it used in AB4?
1. Any example of using a very high-level abstraction in the project?
1. What is coupling? 
   1. `Foo` depends on `Bar` if …?
   1.Give examples of different ways how a class `Foo` can be coupled to `Bar`
1.What is cohesion?
  1.How does cohesion relates to coupling?
1. What is the Principle of SoC? 
   1.How does SoC relates to coupling and cohesion?
1. What is OCP?
   1. Does the project follows OCP? E.g. Can we add a new command or a new storage type without modifying existing code too much? 
1. What is unit/integration/system/acceptance testing?
   1. What’s the difference between unit testing and integration testing?
   1. What’s the difference between system testing and acceptance testing?
1. Which integration approach is used by the project?
1. What is an association class?
   1. IVLE quizzes allow a quiz to be attempted multiple times. For each attempt, it records the time taken. Model this scenario as a class diagram. 
   1. Draw another diagram to describe how you would implement it in code (because programming languages don’t have direct support for association classes).
