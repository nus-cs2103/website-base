Topics for this week form two sections:

1. **%%[W1.1 - W1.5]%% Some OOP and Java ==<tooltip content="i.e., topics you are expected to know already">prereq topics</tooltip>==** (icon %%{{ icon_prereq }}{{ icon_prereq }}%% indicates prereq topics): Go through these topics to refresh your memory, and demonstrate your knowledge by submitting the _Week 1 Quiz (aka prereq topics quiz)_ on Canvas.
1. **%%[[W1.6](#W1-6)]%% Getting Started with Git:** The start of a series of lessons on Git and GitHub — two tools that will be used heavily in this course.

Let's start with the prereq topics.

Now it's time to move to the second section of this week's topics:

To learn Git and GitHub topics, we'll be using the [Git-Mastery site](), a learning resource and a companion app that helps you not only the topics, but also provided auto-graded exercises to self-test your knowledge.

{{ icon_important_big_red }} **The Git-Mastery site is relatively new, and is under active development — teething issues are expected!** Please help us improve it by reporting any issues, bugs, unclear parts, suggestions — even minor/cosmetic ones — in the {{ link_forum }}. You can earn bonus participation points by doing so too.


This week, we start with tour 1.
