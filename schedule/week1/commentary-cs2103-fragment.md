1. **%%[W1.1 - W1.5]%% Some OOP and Java ==<tooltip content="i.e., topics you are expected to know already">prereq topics</tooltip>==** (icon %%{{ icon_prereq }}{{ icon_prereq }}%% indicates prereq topics): Go through these topics to refresh your memory, and demonstrate your knowledge by submitting the _Week 1 Quiz (aka prereq topics quiz)_ on Canvas.
1. **%%[[W1.6](#W1-6)]%% Getting Started with Git:** The start of a series of lessons on Git and GitHub — two tools that will be used heavily in this course.
