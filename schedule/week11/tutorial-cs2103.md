* [Each member] Demo your contribution for v1.3 using the jar file 

**Questions to discuss during tutorial:**

==While the tutor is checking team/individual milestones, divide these questions among team members and get ready to answer them==. 

1. Apply heuristics for combining multiple test inputs to the following test cases, assuming all 6 values in the table need to be tested. :white_check_mark: indicates valid values and :exclamation: indicates invalid values. Point out where the heuristics are contradicted and how to improve the test cases.

   <tip-box> 
   
   SUT: `foo(x,y)`
   
   Test case |  x  |  y
   --------- | --- | ---
   TC1 | :white_check_mark: x1-valid | :white_check_mark: y1-valid
   TC2 | :white_check_mark: x2-valid | :exclamation: y2-invalid
   TC3 | :exclamation: x3-invalid | :exclamation: y3-invalid
   
   </tip-box>
