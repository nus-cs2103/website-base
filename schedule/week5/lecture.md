Imagine you are building an online system called TeamFormer. A brief description of it is given below.


<tip-box>

TeamFormer is a system for helping {{ module_pair }} students during team forming period. It lets students record who is in which team. Students can use the system to find teams short of members and students looking for teams, easing the team forming process. Note that the system is not meant as a platform for students to communicate with each other to find team members. Students are supposed to talk to each other and form teams outside the system, as they do now. TeamFormer simply helps students to see the team forming status of the class (e.g., who has teams and who doesn’t) and record their own team after forming a team. It is also meant to ease the team-forming-related workload of instructors.
