                <p><strong>In the <em>forking workflow</em>, the 'official' version of the software is kept in a remote repo designated as the 'main repo'. All team members fork the main repo create pull requests from their fork to the main repo.</strong></p>
                <p>To illustrate how the workflow goes, let’s assume Jean wants to fix a bug in the code. Here are the steps:</p>
                <ol>
                  <li>Jean creates a separate branch in her local repo and fixes the bug in that branch.</li>
                  <li>Jean pushes the branch to her fork.</li>
                  <li>Jean creates a pull request from that branch in her fork to the main repo.</li>
                  <li>Other members review Jean’s pull request.</li>
                  <li>If reviewers suggested any changes, Jean updates the PR accordingly.</li>
                  <li>When reviewers are satisfied with the PR, one of the members (usually the team lead or a designated 'maintainer' of the main repo) merges the PR, which brings Jean’s code to the main repo.</li>
                  <li>Other members, realizing there is new code in the upstream repo, sync their forks with the new upstream repo (i.e. the main repo). This is done by pulling the new code to their own local repo and pushing the updated code to their own
                    fork.</li>

                <p><strong>RCS can be done in two ways: the <em>centralized</em> way and the <em>distributed</em> way.</strong></p>
                <p><strong>Centralized RCS (CRCS for short)uses a central remote repo that is shared by the team.</strong> Team members download (‘pull’) and upload (‘push’) changes between their own local repositories and the central repository. Older RCS
                  tools such as CVS and SVN support only this model. Note that these older RCS do not support the notion of a local repo either. Instead, they force users to do all the versioning with the remote repo.</p>

                <p><strong>Distributed RCS (DRCS for short, also known as Decentralized RCS) allows multiple remote repos</strong> and pulling and pushing can be done among them in arbitrary ways. The workflow can vary differently from team to team. For
                  example, every team member can have his/her own remote repository in addition to their own local repository, as shown in the diagram below. Git and Mercurial are some prominent RCS tools that support the distributed approach.</p>

                    be due to multiple inter-related bugs.</li>
                  <li><strong>Fixing a bug found during such testing could result in major rework</strong>, especially if the bug originated during the design or during requirements specification (i.e. a faulty design or faulty requirements).</li>

                            <p>Pros:</p>
                            <ul>
                              <li>Can be done early (the earlier we find a bug, the cheaper it is to fix).</li>
                              <li>Can be done at lower levels, for examples, at operation and class level (testers usually test the system at UI level).</li>
                              <li>It is possible to do more thorough testing because developers know the expected external behavior as well as the internal structure of the component.</li>
                              <li>It forces developers to take responsibility for their own work (they cannot claim that &quot;testing is the job of the testers&quot;).</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>Cons:</p>
                            <ul>
                              <li>A developer may unconsciously test only situations that he knows to work (i.e. test it too 'gently').</li>
                              <li>A developer may be blind to his own mistakes (if he did not consider a certain combination of input while writing code, it is possible for him to miss it again during testing).</li>
                              <li>A developer may have misunderstood what the SUT is supposed to do in the first place.</li>
                              <li>A developer may lack the testing expertise.</li>

              <li>Teach the app to accept a <code>sort</code> command but ignore it.</li>
              <li>Next, teach the app to direct the <code>sort</code> command to an existing command e.g. <code>sort</code> command simply invokes the <code>list</code> command internally.</li>

                <p>While all objects of a class has the same attributes, each object has its own copy of the attribute value.</p>
                <tip-box>

                  <p>All <code>Person</code> objects have the <code>Name</code> attribute but the value of that attribute varies between <code>Person</code> objects.</p>
                </tip-box>
                <p>However, some attributes are not suitable to be maintained by individual objects. Instead, they should be maintained centrally, shared by all objects of the class. They are like ‘global variables’ but attached to a specific class. Such
                  <strong>variables whose value is shared by all instances of a class are called <mark><em>class level</em> attributes</mark></strong>.</p>
                <tip-box>
                  <p>Example:</p>
                  <p>The attribute <code>totalPersons</code> should be maintained centrally and shared by all <code>Person</code> objects rather than copied at each <code>Person</code> object.</p>
                </tip-box>
                <p>Similarly, when a normal method is being called, a message is being sent to the receiving object and the result may depend on the receiving object.</p>
                <tip-box>
                  <p>Example:</p>
                  <p>Sending the <code>getName()</code> message to <code>Adam</code> object results in the response <code>&quot;Adam&quot;</code> while sending the same message to the <code>Beth</code> object gets the response <code>&quot;Beth&quot;</code>.</p>
                </tip-box>
                <p>However, there can be methods related to a specific class but not suitable for sending message to a specific object of that class. Such <strong>methods that are called using the class instead of a specific instance are called <mark>class-level methods</mark></strong>.</p>
                <tip-box>
                  <p>Example:</p>
                  <p>The method <code>getTotalPersons()</code> is not suitable to send to a specific <code>Person</code> object <span class="dimmed">because a specific object of the <code>Person</code> class should not know about the total number of <code>Person</code> objects</span>.</p>
                </tip-box>
                <p><strong>Class-level attributes and methods are collectively called <mark><em>class-level members</em></mark></strong> (also called <em>static members</em> sometimes because some programming languages use the keyword <code>static</code>                  to identify class-level members). <strong>They are to be accessed using the class name rather than an instance of the class</strong>.</p>

            <p><strong>Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)</strong>: A class should have one, and only one, reason to change. <sub>-- Robert C. Martin</sub></p>

        <p>If a class has only one responsibility, it needs to change only when there is a change to that responsibility.</p>
        <tip-box>
          <p>📦 Consider a <code>TextUi</code> class that does parsing of the user commands as well as interacting with the user. That class needs to change when the formatting of the UI changes as well as when the syntax of the user command changes. Hence,
            such a class does not follow the SRP.</p>
