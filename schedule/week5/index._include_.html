                <p><strong>In the <em>forking workflow</em>, the 'official' version of the software is kept in a remote repo designated as the 'main repo'. All team members fork the main repo create pull requests from their fork to the main repo.</strong></p>
                <p>To illustrate how the workflow goes, let’s assume Jean wants to fix a bug in the code. Here are the steps:</p>
                <ol>
                  <li>Jean creates a separate branch in her local repo and fixes the bug in that branch.</li>
                  <li>Jean pushes the branch to her fork.</li>
                  <li>Jean creates a pull request from that branch in her fork to the main repo.</li>
                  <li>Other members review Jean’s pull request.</li>
                  <li>If reviewers suggested any changes, Jean updates the PR accordingly.</li>
                  <li>When reviewers are satisfied with the PR, one of the members (usually the team lead or a designated 'maintainer' of the main repo) merges the PR, which brings Jean’s code to the main repo.</li>
                  <li>Other members, realizing there is new code in the upstream repo, sync their forks with the new upstream repo (i.e. the main repo). This is done by pulling the new code to their own local repo and pushing the updated code to their own
                    fork.</li>

                <p><strong>Centralized RCS (CRCS for short)uses a central remote repo that is shared by the team.</strong> Team members download (‘pull’) and upload (‘push’) changes between their own local repositories and the central repository. Older RCS
                  tools such as CVS and SVN support only this model. Note that these older RCS do not support the notion of a local repo either. Instead, they force users to do all the versioning with the remote repo.</p>

                <p><strong>Distributed RCS (DRCS for short, also known as Decentralized RCS) allows multiple remote repos</strong> and pulling and pushing can be done among them in arbitrary ways. The workflow can vary differently from team to team. For
                  example, every team member can have his/her own remote repository in addition to their own local repository, as shown in the diagram below. Git and Mercurial are some prominent RCS tools that support the distributed approach.</p>

                    be due to multiple inter-related bugs.</li>
                  <li><strong>Fixing a bug found during such testing could result in major rework</strong>, especially if the bug originated during the design or during requirements specification (i.e. a faulty design or faulty requirements).</li>

                <p>While all objects of a class has the same attributes, each object has its own copy of the attribute value.</p>
                <tip-box>
                  <p>Example:</p>
                  <p>All <code>Person</code> objects have the Name attribute but the value of that attribute varies between <code>Person</code> objects.</p>
                </tip-box>
                <p>However, some attributes are not suitable to be maintained by individual objects. Instead, they should be maintained centrally, shared by all objects of the class. They are like ‘global variables’ but attached to a specific class. Those
                  are called <em>class level</em> attributes.</p>
                <tip-box>
                  <p>Example:</p>
                  <p>The attribute totalPersons should be maintained centrally and shared by all <code>Person</code> objects rather than copied at each <code>Person</code> object.</p>
                </tip-box>
                <p>Similarly, when a normal method is being called, a message is being sent to the receiving object and the result may depend on the receiving object.</p>
                <tip-box>
                  <p>Example:</p>
                  <p>Sending the getName() message to Adam object results in the response “Adam” while sending the same message to the Beth object gets the response “Beth”.</p>
                </tip-box>
                <p>However, there can be methods related to a specific class but not suitable for sending message to a specific object of that class. Those are called class-level methods.</p>
                <tip-box>
                  <p>Example:</p>
                  <p>The method getTotalPersons() is not suitable to send to a specific <code>Person</code> object.</p>
                </tip-box>
                <p>Class-level attributes and methods are collectively called <em>class-level members</em> (also called <em>static members</em> sometimes because some programming languages use the keyword <code>static</code> to identify class-level members).
                  They are to be accessed using the class name rather than an instance of the class.</p>

                            </ul>
                            <p>Explanation: totalPendingTasks should not be managed by individual Task objects and therefore suitable to be maintained as a class-level variable. The other variables should be managed at instance level as their value varies
                              from instance to instance. e.g., totalStudents for one Course object will differ from totalStudents of another.</p>

                <p>In addition, composition also implies that <strong>there cannot be cyclical links</strong>. In the example below, the notation represents a ‘sub-folder’ relationship between two folders while implying that a Folder cannot be a sub-folder
                  of itself. If the diamond is removed, it is no longer a composition relationship and technically, allows a folder to be subfolder of itself.</p>

              <p>Example:</p>
              <p>Consider a <code>TextUi</code> class that does parsing of the user commands as well as interacting with the user. That class needs to change when the formatting of the UI changes as well as when the syntax of the user command changes. Hence,
                such a class does not follow the SRP.</p>

                <p>An attribute is sometimes used to represent an association. The diagram below depicts a multiplayer <em>Square Game</em> being played on a board comprising of one hundred squares. Each of the squares may be occupied with any number of
                  Pieces, each belonging to a certain player. A piece may or may not be on a square. Note how the association <code>’is on’</code> can be replaced by an <code>isOn</code> attribute of the <code>Piece</code> class. In order to realize the
                  0..1 multiplicity, the isOn attribute can either be null or hold a reference to a Square object.</p>
