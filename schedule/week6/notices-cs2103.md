**💹 Project progress**

* While we allow you to jump straight to AB-4, **we recommend you to play around with the AB-3 code base** (i.e., fork, clone, setup, and enhance)  before moving to AB-4.  You can practice with AB-3 while at the the same time updating docs of AB-4 as required by the next project milestone.

* At this point of the project there are several non-trivial tools you need to learn e.g., JavaFX, Gradle, Travis, Java 8 features, Git, etc. We recommend that you **divide up the learning tasks among team members and plan to learn them gradually** over the next few weeks.

* Be reminded that **your performance in meeting individual/team project milestones** (as detected by our scripts and observed by tutors) **will be counted towards your [project grade under the _project management_ component]({{ module_website }}/admin/project-assessment.html)**. Please do follow exact setup instructions because deviations will affect our script's ability to detect your work.

**💰 After reaching 15 participation points**:

* We encourage you to continue to do module activities (irrespective of whether they have participation points) because **every time you skip a module activity, it can potentially make the remainder of the module a harder for you** to follow, due to the highly-connect and iterative nature of this module.

**🆘 If you need help**

* Do **inform your tutor (or write to the module email) if you are falling behind or cannot cope with the module requirements**. While we try to avoid _hand holding_ or _spoon feeding_ students, we do want to help you keep up with the module pace when necessary.

* **If you encounter any technical difficulties when setting up AB-4**, please post in our forum so that AB-4 developers can follow up with you. Unlike in first year programming modules, there is no guarantee that tutors will know solutions to your technical problems -- it is not reasonable to even expect so. But you can increase your chances of a solution if you post in the forum as soon as you encounter them.
