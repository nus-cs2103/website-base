                    <p>The following description of the <em>Joys of the Programming Craft</em> was taken from Chapter 1 of the famous book
                      <trigger for="modal:mmm" trigger="click"><em>The Mythical Man-Month</em>, by Frederick P. Brooks</trigger>.</p>
                    <blockquote>
                      <p><strong>Why is programming fun? What delights may its practitioner expect as his reward?</strong></p>
                      <p>First is the sheer joy of making things. As the child delights in his mud pie, so the adult enjoys building things, especially things of his own design. I think this delight must be an image of God's delight in making things, a delight
                        shown in the distinctness and newness of each leaf and each snowflake.</p>
                      <p>Second is the pleasure of making things that are useful to other people. Deep within, we want others to use our work and to find it helpful. In this respect the programming system is not essentially different from the child's first
                        clay pencil holder &quot;for Daddy's office.&quot;</p>
                      <p>Third is the fascination of fashioning complex puzzle-like objects of interlocking moving parts and watching them work in subtle cycles, playing out the consequences of principles built in from the beginning. The programmed computer
                        has all the fascination of the pinball machine or the jukebox mechanism, carried to the ultimate.</p>
                      <p>Fourth is the joy of always learning, which springs from the nonrepeating nature of the task. In one way or another the problem is ever new, and its solver learns something: sometimes practical, sometimes theoretical, and sometimes
                        both.</p>
                      <p>Finally, there is the delight of working in such a tractable medium. The programmer, like the poet, works only slightly removed from pure thought-stuff. He builds his castles in the air, from air, creating by the exertion of the
                        imagination. Few media of creation are so flexible, so easy to polish and rework, so readily capable of realizing grand conceptual structures....</p>
                      <p>Yet the program construct, unlike the poet's words, is real in the sense that it moves and works, producing visible outputs separate from the construct itself. It prints results, draws pictures, produces sounds, moves arms. The magic
                        of myth and legend has come true in our time. One types the correct incantation on a keyboard, and a display screen comes to life, showing things that never were nor could be.</p>
                      <p>Programming then is fun because it gratifies creative longings built deep within us and delights sensibilities we have in common with all men.</p>
                    </blockquote>
                    <blockquote>
                      <p><strong>Not all is delight, however, and knowing the inherent woes makes it easier to bear them when they appear.</strong></p>
                      <p>First, one must perform perfectly. The computer resembles the magic of legend in this respect, too. If one character, one pause, of the incantation is not strictly in proper form, the magic doesn't work. Human beings are not accustomed
                        to being perfect, and few areas of human activity demand it. Adjusting to the requirement for perfection is, I think, the most difficult part of learning to program.</p>
                      <p>Next, other people set one's objectives, provide one's resources, and furnish one's information. One rarely controls the circumstances of his work, or even its goal. In management terms, one's authority is not sufficient for his
                        responsibility. It seems that in all fields, however, the jobs where things get done never have formal authority commensurate with responsibility. In practice, actual (as opposed to formal) authority is acquired from the very momentum
                        of accomplishment.</p>
                      <p>The dependence upon others has a particular case that is especially painful for the system programmer. He depends upon other people's programs. These are often maldesigned, poorly implemented, incompletely delivered (no source code
                        or test cases), and poorly documented. So he must spend hours studying and fixing things that in an ideal world would be complete, available, and usable.</p>
                      <p>The next woe is that designing grand concepts is fun; finding nitty little bugs is just work. With any creative activity come dreary hours of tedious, painstaking labor, and programming is no exception.</p>
                      <p>Next, one finds that debugging has a linear convergence, or worse, where one somehow expects a quadratic sort of approach to the end. So testing drags on and on, the last difficult bugs taking more time to find than the first.</p>
                      <p>The last woe, and sometimes the last straw, is that the product over which one has labored so long appears to be obsolete upon (or before) completion. Already colleagues and competitors are in hot pursuit of new and better ideas.
                        Already the displacement of one's thought-child is not only conceived, but scheduled.</p>
                      <p>This always seems worse than it really is. The new and better product is generally not available when one completes his own; it is only talked about. It, too, will require months of development. The real tiger is never a match for
                        the paper one, unless actual use is wanted. Then the virtues of reality have a satisfaction all their own.</p>
                      <p>Of course the technological base on which one builds is always advancing. As soon as one freezes a design, it becomes obsolete in terms of its concepts. But implementation of real products demands phasing and quantizing. The obsolescence
                        of an implementation must be measured against other existing implementations, not against unrealized concepts. The challenge and the mission are to find real solutions to real problems on actual schedules with available resources.</p>
                      <p>This then is programming, both a tar pit in which many efforts have floundered and a creative activity with joys and woes all its own. For many, the joys far outweigh the woes....</p>

                              <p>Justify this statement: Coding is still a ‘design’ activity, not a ‘manufacturing’ activity. You may use a comparison (or an analogy) of Software engineering versus Civil Engineering to argue this point.</p>
                              <div slot="answer">
                                <p>Arguments to support this statement:</p>
                                <ul>
                                  <li>If coding is a manufacturing activity, we should be able to do it using robotic machines (just like in the car industry) or low-skilled laborers (like in the construction industry).</li>
                                  <li>If coding is a manufacturing activity, we wouldn’t be changing it so much after we code software. But if the code is in fact a ‘design’, yes, we would fiddle with it until we get it right.</li>
                                  <li>Manufacturing is the process of building a finished product based on the design. Code is the design. Manufacturing is what is done by the compiler (fully automated).</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>However, the type of ‘design’ that occurs during coding is at a much lower level than the ‘design’ that occurs before coding.</p>

                  <p><strong>Professional software engineers often write code using <em>Integrated Development Environments (IDEs)</em>. IDEs support all development-related work within the same tool.</strong></p>
                  <p>An IDE generally consists of:</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>A source code editor that includes features such as syntax coloring, auto-completion, easy code navigation, error highlighting, and code-snippet generation.</li>
                    <li>A compiler and/or an interpreter (together with other build automation support) that facilitates the compilation/linking/running/deployment of a program.</li>
                    <li>A debugger that allows the developer to execute the program one step at a time to observe the run-time behavior in order to locate bugs.</li>
                    <li>Other tools that aid various aspects of coding e.g. support for automated testing, drag-and-drop construction of UI components, version management support, simulation of the target runtime platform, and modeling support.</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>Examples of popular IDEs:</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Java: Eclipse, Intellij IDEA, NetBeans</li>
                    <li>C#, C++: Visual Studio</li>
                    <li>Swift: XCode</li>
                    <li>Python: PyCharm</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>Some Web-based IDEs have appeared in recent times too e.g., Amazon's <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cloud9/">Cloud9 IDE</a>.</p>
                  <p>Some experienced developers, in particular those with a UNIX background, prefer lightweight yet powerful text editors with scripting capabilities (e.g. <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/">Emacs</a>) over heavier IDEs.</p>

                        <p>Here is another definition of testing:</p>
                        <blockquote>
                          <p>Software testing consists of the <em>dynamic</em> verification that a program provides <em>expected</em> behaviors on a <em>finite</em> set of test cases, suitably <em>selected</em> from the usually infinite execution domain.

                        <p>Some things to note (indicated by keywords in the above definition):</p>
                        <ul>
                          <li><em>Dynamic</em>: Testing involves executing the software. It is not by examining the code statically.</li>
                          <li><em>Finite</em>: In most non-trivial cases there are potentially infinite test scenarios but resource constraints dictate that we can test only a finite number of scenarios.</li>
                          <li><em>Selected</em>: In most cases it is not possible to test all scenarios. That means we need to select what scenarios to test.</li>
                          <li><em>Expected</em>: Testing requires some knowledge of how the software is expected to behave.</li>

                      <p><strong>A simple way to semi-automate testing of a CLI(Command Line Interface) app is by using input/output re-direction.</strong></p>
                      <ul>

                      <p>Let us assume we are testing a CLI app called <code>AddressBook</code>. Here are the detailed steps:</p>
                      <ol>
                        <li>
                          <p>Store the test input in the text file <code>input.txt</code>.</p>

                          <p>Run the program as given below, which will redirect the text in <code>input.txt</code> as the input to <code>AddressBook</code> and similarly, will redirect the output of AddressBook to a text file <code>output.txt</code>.

                              <p>💡 The way to run a CLI program differs based on the language.<br> e.g., In Python, assuming the code is in <code>AddressBook.py</code> file, use the command<br>
                                <code>python AddressBook.py &lt; input.txt &gt; output.txt</code></p>
                            </li>

                              <p>💡 If you are using Windows, use a normal command window to run the app, not a Power Shell window.</p>
                            </li>

                            <p>A CLI program takes input from the keyboard and outputs to the console. That is because those two are default input and output streams, respectively. But you can change that behavior using <code>&lt;</code> and <code>&gt;</code>                              operators. For example, if you run <code>AddressBook</code> in a command window, the output will be shown in the console, but if you run it like this,</p>
                            <pre><code class="hljs sh">java AddressBook &gt; output.txt 
</code></pre>
                            <p>the Operating System then creates a file <code>output.txt</code> and stores the output in that file instead of displaying it in the console. No file I/O coding is required. Similarly, adding <code>&lt; input.txt</code> (or
                              any other filename) makes the OS redirect the contents of the file as input to the program, as if the user typed the content of the file one line at a time.</p>

                          <p>Next, we compare <code>output.txt</code> with the <code>expected.txt</code>. This can be done using a utility such as Windows <code>FC</code> (i.e. File Compare) command, Unix <code>diff</code> command, or a GUI tool such as
                            <em>WinMerge</em>.</p>

                      <p>Note that the above technique is only suitable when testing CLI apps, and only if the exact output can be predetermined. <span class="dimmed">If the output varies from one run to the other (e.g. it contains a time stamp), this technique will not work.

                    <p>Revision control is also known as <em>Version Control Software (VCS)</em>, and a few other names. Here, we use the terms <em>revision</em> and <em>version</em> interchangeably.</p>

                          <p><em>Revision control</em> is the process of managing multiple versions of a piece of information. In its simplest form, this is something that many people do by hand: every time you modify a file, save it under a new name that
                            contains a number, each one higher than the number of the preceding version.</p>
                          <p>Manually managing multiple versions of even a single file is an error-prone task, though, so software tools to help automate this process have long been available. The earliest automated revision control tools were intended to
                            help a single user to manage revisions of a single file. Over the past few decades, the scope of revision control tools has expanded greatly; they now manage multiple files, and help multiple people to work together. The best
                            modern revision control tools have no problem coping with thousands of people working together on projects that consist of hundreds of thousands of files.</p>
                          <p>There are a number of reasons why you or your team might want to use an automated revision control tool for a project. It will track the history and evolution of your project, so you don't have to. For every change, you'll have
                            a log of who made it; why they made it; when they made it; and what the change was.</p>
                          <p>When you're working with other people, <strong>revision control software makes it easier for you to collaborate</strong>. For example, when people more or less simultaneously make potentially incompatible changes, the software
                            will help you to identify and resolve those conflicts.</p>
                          <p><strong>It can help you to recover from mistakes</strong>. If you make a change that later turns out to be an error, you can revert to an earlier version of one or more files. In fact, a really good revision control tool will
                            even help you to efficiently figure out exactly when a problem was introduced.</p>
                          <p><strong>It will help you to work simultaneously on, and manage the drift between, multiple versions of your project.</strong> Most of these reasons are equally valid, at least in theory, whether you're working on a project by
                            yourself, or with a hundred other people.</p>
