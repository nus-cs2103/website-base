* **Quiz results will be posted** in the forum. Participation marks for lecture participation (based on quiz participation) will be posted on IVLE gradebook soon. If you have any queries/objections about your marks, please write to the module email `{{ module | lower }}@comp.nus.edu.sg`.

* We will be adding you all to {{ module | lower }}-{{ semester }} github org. **Please accept the invitation sent by GitHub** as you need to be a member of the org for some of the future module activities. If you did not receive the invitation link, you can use the link [https://github.com/orgs/nus-{{ module | lower }}-{{ semester }}/invitation](https://github.com/orgs/nus-{{ module | lower }}-{{ semester }}/invitation).

* Get started on the project (i.e., defining your project direction and requirements). **Try to do at least step 1 of [mid-v1.0 project milestone]({{ module_website }}/admin/project-w04-inception.html)** before coming to the tutorial this week, and try to finish the remainder by the end of this week.

* A heads up: **next week is going to be HEAVY** 😨 as it has two graded tasks -- both require significant team efforts and a substantial time period to complete. We urge you all to **make full use of this week to prepare yourself for that challenge**. In particular,
  * Try to reach [mid-v1.0]({{ module_website }}/admin/project-w04-inception.html) fully by the end of this week i.e., complete all 3 steps.
  * If you are not familiar with Git and GitHub, complete this week's topics related to Git and GitHub. Next week's topics need that knowledge.
  * If you are not familiar with JUnit, try to do the PR for **`W4.11e`**. Tutors will review the PRs over the weekend and will give you feedback before next week.

* **A practice peer evaluation/feedback session** will be set up on TEAMMATES. You should receive the submission link by Thursday noon. This session is for you get get used to the system and also to get to know the evaluation criteria. This round of peer evaluations are not used for grading. Email `{{ module | lower }}@comp.nus.edu.sg` if you did not receive the submission link on time.

* **One part of this week's lecture is not covered in the textbook** and is relevant for your project work for the upcoming project milestone v1.0. You are encouraged to attend this week's lecture even if you don't normally come to lectures.
